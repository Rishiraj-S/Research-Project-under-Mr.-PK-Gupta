Pranjal Chakraborti Industry Advisor, Payments Practice, BFSI, TCS Kiran Kumar GK Consultant, BFSI, TCS Abhilash Kaduthanum Global Head, Payments Practice, BFSI, TCS You have these already downloaded We have sent you a copy of the report to your email again. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) has announced that the coexistence period for MT and ISO 20022 standards for cross-border payments will end in November 2025.1 Using the MT message standard beyond Nov 2025 will come at a cost. Immediate migration to the ISO 20022 standard has thus emerged as an urgent imperative for banks, and most financial institutions are well on the road to adoption. At the same time, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), has arrived as the hottest technology kid on the block with tremendous transformative potential for the payments industry, capturing mindshare of banks, financial institutions, payment networks and service providers, and fintechs. ISO 20022 and GenAI were separate threads at their origin, but are now converging with the potential to create some interesting use cases in the payments industry. While ISO 20022 is widely used for automated digital payments, its application in manual payment processes is equally important, especially in scenarios involving exceptions, corrections, or non-standard transactions. ISO 20022 can bring significant improvements to both automated and manual payment processing through standardized messaging, enhanced data accuracy, and improved tracking. In addition, complete migration to the ISO 20022 messaging standard will enable banks and payment service providers to access a large repository of ‘ISO-rich’ transaction data. By applying GenAI tools to this data, they can create innovative use cases for different stakeholders, unlocking new business value and disrupting the payments ecosystem. Banks and financial institutions must traverse a three-stage journey—compliance, internalization and value realization—for complete adoption. A graphic showing the three stages in the adoption of the ISO 20022 messaging standard. The figure depicts the three stages which are compliance, internalization, and value realization that banks must navigate to take advantage of monetization opportunities offered by ‘ISO-rich’ data. Compliance: Achieve compliance mandated by SWIFT and other payment schemes and central banks. Internalization: Establish ISO 20022 as the native message format with internal canonical message and data model based on ISO 20022. Value realization: Leverage the rich data collected during the transaction process for monetization. Many global payment infrastructures have moved to the ISO 20022 standard. The ISO 20022 standard is now in widespread use for cross-border payments through the SWIFT Cross-Border Payments and Reporting Plus (SWIFT CBPR+) specification. In these markets, banks have substantially increased the degree of straight-through processing (STP) but other significant use cases are yet to emerge. We believe that the payments landscape will further evolve with the increased adoption of enhanced datasets like legal entity identifiers (LEI), purpose code, and so on. Additionally, GenAI is poised to expand at an exponential rate in the financial services industry with spends from the banking industry expected to touch $85 billion in 2030 from $6 billion in 2024.2 So, how can banks and payment service providers unlock the potential of the powerful combination represented by ISO 20022 and GenAI, convert opportunities into revenue, and accelerate value realization? The clue lies in rich data, a key attribute of ISO 20022. ISO 20022 can carry significant structured data about a payment transaction spanning commercial information and invoice details of a particular payment transaction, thus binding payments and commerce together. So far, this aspect was missing from message protocols resulting in payments and commerce remaining in silos necessitating huge effort spends on reconciliation. The data-rich aspect of the ISO 20022 standard has paved the way for the application of GenAI techniques, ushering in innovative use cases. Evaluating the payment workflows of banks across different stages reveals multiple areas where GenAI interventions can enhance efficiency and create innovative use cases (see Figure 2). A graphic showing the payment workflows of banks through various stages. It also depicts several areas such as channel systems, authentication, fraud detection, and risk management, among others, where GenAI technology can be leveraged to help increase efficiency, create new use cases, and enhance business value. Opportunities for GenAI interventions in payment workflows Let us examine how the application of GenAI to ISO 20022 data can supercharge various areas of the payments domain. Payment initiation: GenAI tools can be employed at the backend to leverage transaction history and ISO 20022 data (pain.001 messages) as well as other ecosystem data to offer payment assistance to customers and enhance experience. For instance, GenAI backed chatbots can be deployed to prompt customers to pay a particular bill through a real-time payment option as the deadline is close or use a specific credit card that might give loyalty points or special discounts from the service provider. When payments are initiated from super apps or ecommerce apps, timely prompts can enhance customer experience. Payment routing and orchestration: The payments industry is now moving toward outcome based payments and multi-rail processing, which demand smart routing, orchestration, and workflow management. GenAI can play a significant role in this space and enable payment engines to move away from predefined rule-based routing thus improving payment outcomes for customers. Customer experience: ISO 20022 provides information about the payer, payee, and the transaction (commercial information about the product or service purchased). GenAI tools can be deployed to profile customers based on this data and the insights generated can be used for targeted marketing through personalized offers, cross-sell, and upsell, among others. It can also be used to extend differentiated loyalty and reward programs to customers. Fraud management: The additional data provided by ISO 20022 can be used to design GenAI backed smarter predictive models to enable real time detection and prevention of fraud. Real-time monitoring and detection of fraud and initiating action to prevent it is set to assume critical importance given the increasing pace at which nations are moving toward instant payments. Compliance: GenAI can help generate data for regulatory reporting based on the detailed payment data obtained through ISO 20022. This will greatly ease the regulatory burden for banks by enhancing the efficiency of compliance processes and reducing costs. Personal financial management: GenAI tools can be deployed to build dashboards that deliver insights on  spend patterns to customers. Based on this, banks can offer advice on budgetary controls and achieving financial objectives. Once again, rich data carried by ISO 20022 will be the key enabler for such value-added services. Payment operations: GenAI can help monitor payment engines and proactively predict glitches in automated and manual payment processes, allowing banks to initiate preventive action, greatly enhancing efficiency and customer experience. Moreover, GenAI can help enable smart and intelligent routing from the payment orchestration layer to payment engines by leveraging historical transaction data supplied by ISO 20022. Other service areas that can benefit from GenAI include customer onboarding, know your customer (KYC) processing, dispute management and so on. Business-to-business (B2B) payments: Business and corporate customers can benefit by using GenAI to initiate payments, enhancing efficiency in the B2B payments space through higher accuracy and automation. With GenAI, banks and payment service providers can scan and pull out data from invoices, match them with corresponding purchase orders and contracts, and automatically route invoices for approval basis predefined rules, thus achieving higher accuracy in straight-through processing (STP). Customer support services: GenAI enabled chatbots and ‘ISO-rich’ information form a powerful combination, greatly enhancing the quality of customer service and support. Based on past data, GenAI can anticipate issues and proactively address them through personalized solutions. Payment systems: GenAI can also boost productivity and lower the cost of developing and testing payment systems. Additionally, it can help in generation of payment test cases from ISO 20022 data, ensuring coverage of a larger number of scenarios. PA-DSS compliant code generation for payment system development is also possible using GenAI. In our view, GenAI use cases in the payments domain (see Figure 3) will further evolve over a period of time and usher in disruptive transformation in the future. The development of dedicated payment specific large language models (LLMs) to further enhance prospects cannot be ruled out. A graphic showing the use cases that will evolve in the payments domain in the future. Going forward, these use cases have the potential to bring in disruptive transformation in the payments domain. However, banks must tread cautiously and establish adequate guardrails to address the ethical concerns around GenAI applications. Furthermore, considering the critical importance of payment systems in business-as-usual operations, banks must pay special attention to risk management, operational resilience, and payment-specific compliance obligations. ISO 20022 implementation comes with its own pitfalls. Inconsistent data formats, need for significant reconciliation effort—especially in manual payments—system incompatibilities, and challenges in achieving regulatory compliance can hinder seamless transition. Successful adoption will necessitate: Case-in-point A Europe based mid-sized financial institution faced challenges in manual payment processing, including frequent errors, slow reconciliation, and regulatory compliance issues. The institution implemented ISO 20022, focusing on standardizing data formats, enhancing data accuracy, and improving reconciliation. With this implementation, the bank realized some key benefits: ‘ISO-rich’ data has the potential to fuel GenAI innovation and dramatically transform payments. The right monetization strategy, however, will be crucial to capitalize on the opportunities offered by the dynamic combination of GenAI and ISO 20022. To ensure hassle-free migration and integration, banks and payment service providers may need to partner with appropriate service providers with the requisite technology and domain expertise as well as implementation experience after a well-rounded market analysis. Quick action is key—banks that act fast will benefit from the first-mover advantage and gain a lead over their peers. 1Integrated Research, A Guide to ISO 20022 Migration and Adoption, April 2024, February 2025, https://www.ir.com/guides/iso-20022-migration# 2Juniper Research, Generative AI Spending from Banking Industry to Grow by over 1400% by 2030, as Banks Seek to Scale AI to Revolutionise Business Models, January 2024, February 2025, https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/generative-ai-spending-from-banking-industry-to-grow-by-over-1-400-by-2030-as-banks-seek-to-scale-ai-to-revolutionise-business-models/ Generative AI in Finance: Opening up a Sea of Possibilities Payments Solution - TCS BaNCS for Payments Streamlining Card Payments Testing for Seamless Real-time Payments Digital and personalized future of merchant services Ready to move from enterprise to ecosystem?

Generative AI (genAI) allows eBooks to transcend the limitations of physical pages. The printing press once revolutionized distribution systems, but the core reading experience of physical books remained unchanged until eReaders came into the picture. While they offer portability, eReaders lack true innovation. GenAI-powered eBooks can fill this gap. They are a dynamic, interactive evolution that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and next-generation technologies to create an immersive reading experience. GenAI-powered eBooks can personalize the reader’s experience based on their emotions and need for focus. Imagine starting a book and seamlessly transitioning to an audiobook version during your commute, complete with background music, setting the scene's mood. These eBooks can adapt to one's environment, narrating chapters with sound effects while driving and displaying text with curated background music when stationary. Text and audio can even be synchronized, highlighting words as they are spoken, creating an immersive reading experience. With genAI, you need a separate audio track created for the eBook; the feature comes integrated. These eBooks can also serve as tools for breaking down language barriers while elevating the reading experience through real-time translations. The narrative seamlessly flows as the eBook translates each sentence, unlocking a world of literature previously inaccessible. Additionally, they can offer multi-lingual narration and immersive experiences. GenAI-enabled eBooks can be especially helpful for developing minds. These intelligent eBooks can dynamically create a picture with every chapter, depicting key scenes and characters, fostering a deeper connection with the narrative. Interactive elements like embedded games and educational activities can enhance understanding and engage young readers. Text complexity can be adjusted, transforming complex sentences into simpler ones and making the story age appropriate. GenAI-enabled eBooks foster a richer reading experience through social interaction. Readers can highlight passages, share annotations, and spark discussions using the eBook itself. Authors can participate, offer insights, and answer questions directly through the platform, fostering a sense of community and helping deepen the reader’s understanding of the text. The eBook could optimize AI for autobiographies to analyze the author's existing recordings and create a virtual voice that reads specific passages or answers user queries. This creates a more personal connection with the author and their story. Unlike static physical books, genAI can make eBooks go beyond passive consumption. When faced with a challenging passage or a historical reference requiring more information, the reader can highlight the text and ask for the eBook. It can act as an intelligent tutor and provide summaries, historical context, or relevant multimedia content, deepening the reader’s understanding. This interactive learning experience fosters a deeper connection with the material. This format can be revolutionary for those with different forms of disabilities. GenAI-enabled eBooks can enhance the reading experience of those with disabilities by making every book more accessible through features like dynamic readout, adding background sounds, and even video avatars displaying sign language.

To effectively augment knowledge workers, businesses must artfully combine, orchestrate, and engineer multiple GenAI and AI models. Enterprises have made major strides in transforming work processes. Automation efficiencies and productivity gains have been realized through AI and machine learning, analytics, and various software solutions. With the emergence of GenAI models, a vast frontier of opportunity also awaits to boost the effectiveness of knowledge workers. Due to its highly nuanced nature, knowledge work, such as underwriting for banking or developing clinical protocols for drug trials, has been difficult to address through traditional AI. Because knowledge work typically involves intricate problem-solving with no clear-cut answers, decision-making is evaluated based on quality. Engineering AI augmentation capabilities for improved enterprise decisioning at scale is no trivial matter. A new choice architecture is needed to build AI systems that can deliver domain reasoning reliably and safely. Sankaranarayanan “Shanky” Viswanathan Moreover, no single AI model exists that can approximate how a human brain thinks and reasons. Building an ultimate model is an impractical goal. There is no universal definition for knowledge work which tends to vary widely among industries, enterprises, and business functions. The ultimate challenge is posed by trying to replicate the complex ability of critical reasoning in knowledge work for making effective decisions based on different contexts with consistent results. Today, it is possible for industry leaders to address this challenge for business functions with high knowledge concentration. The constant nudging of a formal digitalized and seamlessly integrated AI augmentation capability can provide an organization’s knowledge workers expert guidance on the right decision to make in different contexts. In other words, “Knowledge work transformation is now possible to achieve as an output of knowledge worker transformation through personalized AI augmentation,” explains Sankaranarayanan “Shanky” Viswanathan, Vice President and Head of Strategic Business Initiatives, Corporate Technology Office, TCS. “Engineering AI augmentation capabilities for improved enterprise decisioning at scale is no trivial matter. A new choice architecture is needed to build AI systems that can deliver domain reasoning reliably and safely.” Enabling a personalized AI augmentation capability will boost the overall performance of knowledge workers while lowering the skill threshold. Enterprise GenAI tools can be used to discern and encode the tacit knowledge and reasoning ability of an organization’s subject matter experts as a digital capability. A system of models and tools must be carefully orchestrated and built to enable this capability. An AI-powered genius partner, or specialist copilot, can then effectively augment other knowledge workers across the enterprise with that expert knowledge. Democratizing knowledge and empowering employees to perform at an expert level will yield constant, consistent, and predictable business outcomes. Moreover, leveraging such expertise at scale is not just about helping employees make the right calls when decisions are needed—it is equally about not making the wrong calls which could have implications for the enterprise. In essence, businesses can advance their use of AI from enabling automation efficiencies for noncore, repetitive work tasks to boosting the overall quality of core, knowledge-intensive tasks that deliver higher value. An infographic depicting personalized AI augmentation in an enterprise. The highest level of tacit knowledge among knowledge workers is encoded with a critical reasoning ability for use across the enterprise. AI-powered genius partners are used to augment other knowledge workers with that expert knowledge. Democratizing knowledge and empowering employees to perform at an expert level facilitates enterprise decision-making at scale. Expressed as ƒ(Genius partners)n, improved decision-making enabled through personalized AI augmentation will yield constant, consistent, and predictable outcomes for both the enterprise and its clients. Boosting performance across the enterprise through personalized AI augmentation As options for AI and GenAI models continue to grow, so does the business community’s optimism for applying them. The Working Towards the Future Report prepared by TCS, based on a global survey of prominent futurists, executives, and foresight professionals, concluded that 90% of them are optimistic about AI-driven changes to how people work. AI is expected to level the playing field by providing workers of different levels equal access to information and capabilities, driving increased engagement, ideation, and innovation. Based on the TCS AI for Business Study Key Findings Report conducted globally, CEOs and other senior execs surveyed believe the impact of AI will be greater or equal to that of the internet (54%) and smartphones (59%). However, relatively few of the respondents (only 4%) have leveraged AI in a way that is transformative for their business. An integrated, AI-first approach can facilitate the building of a reasoning system based on the right augmentation strategy for addressing enterprise-specific intelligence needs. What does it take to build an advanced reasoning system? First, it’s important to understand that intelligent AI reasoning used in complex decision-making generally involves multiple methods, such as: For instance, a contact center may primarily leverage logical or analogical methods. Augmenting clinical trial scientists, insurance underwriters, or retail category managers, however, will typically depend on more complex experiential reasoning. Determining the right AI models to mimic human reasoning is therefore as much an art as it is a science. While traditional AI might be the sensible choice for some predictive intelligence scenarios, the type or lack of data might require a GenAI model. Or if a particular scenario demands more preciseness, a GenAI model may need fine-tuning for optimization. In other instances, some activities that are more structured in nature with access to standardized data may not necessitate a GenAI capability at all. Enabling a robust reasoning system that can effectively perform myriad intelligence functions is essential for implementing a personalized knowledge augmentation strategy. A composite approach can facilitate the need to toggle between different models in addressing the specific intelligence needs of a business. Rather than trying to model the multifaceted functions of an entire human brain, the focus is on understanding and modeling how an individual performs a very narrow or finite set of knowledge work activities. Augmenting the decision-making abilities of knowledge workers in selectively targeted areas will yield elite outcomes with higher returns. There are many opportunities to drive value creation through the personalized augmentation of workers in knowledge-intensive business functions across industries. As CEOs, COOs, and business unit heads assess opportunities, they should focus on where they can increase, or potentially even double, their productivity without necessarily increasing their capacity (learn more about becoming a knowledge-driven enterprise). A few standout examples of opportunities for reimagining knowledge work include: To illustrate, consider the benefits of leveraging GenAI in a global architectural firm. Engineers and architects are tasked with balancing client design expectations against material performance and complex building codes and safety standards that differ between states and countries. They may also need to adapt designs and construction based on new materials or laws. But imagine if the firm could efficiently capture all relevant information learned on a project and distribute it for future use across the business. The shared experience and learnings could facilitate more effective decision-making and faster completion of projects. The potential benefits of enabling personalized AI augmentation to advance the performance of knowledge workers are significant. To drive impactful transformation, however, businesses must step diligently through the journey. Selectively augmenting workers in strategically targeted areas of an enterprise versus taking a jackhammer approach is key to optimizing returns. There are three levels of advancement to build and scale a reasoning system with a personalized AI augmentation capability. For starters, modeling knowledge-intensive tasks for personalized augmentation involves working closely with subject matter experts to pinpoint where contextual experience heavily influences business outcomes. Driving success requires a deep understanding of the work's intricacies. From there, what does the journey to transform knowledge work actually look like? What are the key factors enterprises must consider along the way? An infographic depicting the transformation of knowledge work to unlock greater business value by building a reasoning system that enables personalized AI augmentation. The journey advances through three levels of value, as the complexity and sophistication of the reasoning system and augmentation capability increases. The first level, or information synthesis, focuses on the extraction, classification, and summarization of information for understanding. This level requires enterprise context and language abilities, based on high quality enterprise data, to enable search and summarization. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is used for natural language processing. The second level, or task optimization, focuses on knowledge-driven actions for improving work effectiveness. In addition to enterprise context and language abilities, this level requires task alignment. The level depends on both semi-structured and unstructured data of varying quality for assimilation and dissemination as well as accuracy of responses. The third level, or personalized augmentation, focuses on the use of specialist genius partners for orchestrating work with context. In addition to enterprise context, this level requires domain alignment, reasoning abilities, and human alignment. At this level, data is Ioosely curated and mostly unstructured in nature. AI agent-based systems are therefore used to help manage the multi-step process execution and ensure the delivery of quality outcomes with consistency. Engineering capabilities to unlock greater value with GenAI and AI augmentation The transformation journey to build a reasoning system with an AI augmentation capability can be broken down into three major levels of increasing value and complexity: Because enterprise data that exists in traditional form is engineered for processing and optimization by systems, it generally lacks the meaningful context required for processing by humans. One of the biggest misconceptions enterprises have is that they can simply feed such data to an LLM or other generative model. They expect that it will be able to automatically understand the data. Generative models behave like human beings and must be fed data in a similar way. The models need enterprise context to understand the import of the pattern, including the insights and reasoning that will drive a particular outcome. In effect, it is important to understand that training a generative model is not akin to how traditional models get trained. Rather, a huge amount of effort, insight, and care is needed to curate, make available, and fine-tune the data for enterprise use. The user interface of the reasoning system should be designed to facilitate a frictionless and immersive augmentation experience for the knowledge workers executing the business processes. The augmentation capability should be seamlessly woven into the existing systems of an enterprise to efficiently nudge workers along with the right directional inputs for making effective decisions. Autonomous agents can significantly enhance AI augmentation capabilities while ensuring adherence to goals, rules, and constraints. Today’s AI-driven models are not sentient, or self-aware, and developing such an ability is unlikely for the foreseeable future. They have the potential to get carried away by their creative abilities and fall out of alignment with the scope of work for achieving desired business outcomes. They may start to exhibit artificial insanity, acting erratically and generating nonsensical outputs. Without security guardrails in place to enforce enterprise policies, models may unknowingly share sensitive information and generate responses that are false, biased, or profane in nature. Similar to how humans need to be trained on the expectations and rules of operation for an enterprise, generative models must also be trained on what is and is not permissible behavior. Otherwise, the models have no way to keep themselves in check and self-correct. That’s where the important role of autonomous AI agents comes into play (learn more about guardrails). Everyone is especially concerned about GenAI’s propensity for hallucinations, but it’s actually an inherent feature and not a design flaw—just like humans, they are prone to overextend when their knowledge is insufficient to answer. Narendran Sivakumar An agentic AI-based system must be built and enabled with specific engineering capabilities to train the models for enterprise use. AI agents must each be tasked with a specific purpose that aligns with the goal of a particular knowledge activity—from enhancing data analysis and generating domain reports to optimizing decision-making processes. “Everyone is especially concerned about GenAI’s propensity for hallucinations, but it’s actually an inherent feature and not a design flaw—just like humans, they are prone to overextend when their knowledge is insufficient to answer,” explains Narendran Sivakumar, Global GTM Lead, Generative AI, Corporate Technology Office, TCS. “Hallucinations are core to how generative models creatively think and produce outputs. To make the models trustworthy for enterprise use, you need to build a highly structured reasoning system and optimize it with autonomous AI agents to effectively harness their creative genius.” In a way, agents can infuse a nuanced form of sentience into the intelligence fabric by being purpose-driven and contextually relevant. They will continuously learn, self-correct, and iterate until the desired outcomes for a specified set of knowledge activities are achieved. An infographic depicting three qualities of effective agentic AI system design. In the first quality, goal-oriented and policy-bound agents operate based on a set of explicit goals within policy-based systems that dictate permissible actions upon an intelligence layer. These actions are enriched with relevant knowledge to drive quality outcomes. In the second quality, seamless integration, agent goals are intrinsically linked to knowledge activities. They direct model operations to achieve objectives in an informed and effective manner. In the third quality, constraints satisfied, agents make decisions that respect constraints based on a comprehensive understanding of the relevant knowledge domain. They help ensure compliance with ethical and operational guidelines. Three qualities of effective agentic AI system design A multi-model approach to enterprise GenAI can be successfully enabled with an advanced reasoning system when underpinned by purpose-bound, autonomous AI agents. By empowering knowledge workers with a personalized AI augmentation capability, businesses can drive transformative business value across the enterprise and optimize their investment returns.

Unequal bytes Information services (IS) enterprises depend on rule-based or supervised learning models, which are limited in their efficacy in detecting irregularities. Credit bureaus, rating agencies, and information services providers rely heavily on externally sourced financial transactions and market data. They've established an error-detection process using proprietary models that generate judgment on creditworthiness, while providing other analytics. This evaluation has a far-reaching impact while assessing an individual's or a company's financial stability and ability to secure credit. Rule-based anomaly detection for externally sourced data is standard practice, though not scalable, or capable of detecting new or unknown scenarios for current and new channels. GenAI will allow irregularity detection in the source data during ingestion, reducing manual interventions and minimizing costs in the long run. Lenders would have access to accurate data, allowing them to extend the desired credit to consumers and companies. Sifting through data For information services providers, data anomalies can prove expensive. Anomalies in data can vary, and the cause could be related to source system errors or human irregularity. Basing credit decisions on erroneous data can lead to considerable loss for the individual or the organization with far-reaching social and economic impact. Fraudulent activity in such cases can cause irreparable damage to enterprises. Errors in credit reports can be attributed to not being able to detect unknown scenarios properly. The direct impact of poor credit scores on consumers can range from higher insurance premiums to higher interest rates on credit, or even denial of credit. Currently, most IS enterprises follow a rule-based system for anomaly detection, which involves continual monitoring of incoming data. This system has hundreds or even thousands of rules, which are updated whenever a new scenario occurs as the data moves into downstream systems. The updates to these rules and their execution to detect errors are iterative, requiring manual intervention and supervision. Credit rating providers need to invest in safeguarding processes against poor-quality data through iterative manual interventions and continuous rule updates. In most situations, the technologies in use are outdated and resistant to detection of new anomaly patterns. With AI-ML, some of these processes have become more streamlined, with AI techniques being leveraged to improve data anomaly detection. Enterprises must continuously invest in technology programs to improve data quality while deploying an adequate workforce to oversee and intervene when needed. With GenAI, anomaly detection can become significantly advanced with high efficiency gains. Pioneering change Rule-based anomaly detection requires knowledge of all possible unusual scenarios, while GenAI can detect new irregularities in a dataset. Often, with source datasets, there are two challenges: Unlike rule-based systems and traditional AI approaches, GenAI learns, adapts, and applies knowledge from datasets to infer scenarios, simulating a near-human interpretation. GenAI-enabled anomaly detection can: Automate simulation: This can be done using the typical data ingestion pipeline of a credit rating provider. The approach used is a pioneering methodology for the ‘unknown unknowns’ situation, wherein transaction data is processed through a GenAI-based model to determine its quality. For the simulation, an automated batch process was developed to analyze the incoming data, and the solution was designed to continuously detect inconsistent data patterns, through semi-supervised machine learning on an ongoing basis. A trading information dataset was prepared as input data and used for training and testing anomaly detection. Some of the key fields used in the data set included: For execution and detecting the anomalies, a thousand records were generated with one or more of the following anomalies: About 100,000 clean data records were created for training and testing the model prior to the execution with anomalistic data. A two-stage approach was adopted to identify bad data and attribute reasons for the anomaly within the data set, using: Feature engineering was leveraged for the date fields, and different hyperparameters were tuned over a hundred iterations to conduct this simulation using Google Colab with Google Vertex AI. The technology stack included TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, and Openpyxl. The simulation model was tested using a new set of bad and good data which resulting in: Moving ahead with GenAI Integration of GenAI in anomaly detection for credit decisioning can optimize costs, mitigate risks, and improve accuracy. GenAI can automatically detect and filter out unknown errors using supervised learning models, improving the efficacy of data quality frameworks. This technique and approach can be applied to a variety of different other use cases across different industry domains which require data analysis, like network fault detection or fraud detection, leading to enhanced report accuracy and speed. Automated detection algorithms can also be applied before rule-based data quality checks. Enterprises using this approach will be able to replace expensive data quality tools with a manageable and automated data quality check engine, that requires easy maintenance. By integrating GenAI-powered data quality pipeline for anomaly detection, credit rating providers can enable a fundamentally clean data backbone for their products and services.

In today's digital landscape, it is crucial to protect applications against vulnerabilities and potential breaches. GenAI can significantly enhance application security compliance. By utilizing the natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of large language models (LLMs), generative AI can assess application security compliance and provide guidance to architects and developers on how to make their applications more robust and secure. In addition, GenAI assists in continuously improving security measures by analyzing application-specific information, application architecture, adhering to the latest threat trends and updated security policies and guidelines. This ensures the availability of valuable insights to developers, helping them refine existing security protocols and adopt robust countermeasures. The complexity of modern applications can make security assessment challenging. Enterprises currently need to work through: As per this study by Statista, the average spend per employee in the cybersecurity market is projected to reach $52.16 in 2024. This shows the upward trend of organisational spend on securing data, emphasising the need for a sustainable solution for application security assessments. Generative AI can not only conduct continuous application security assessment, but it can also provide suggestions to further fortify the enterprise security. GenAI can help develop security co-pilots to conduct comprehensive security assessments on user applications. These AI-powered co-pilots can summarize assessment results, assign application security ratings, and offer recommendations to enhance application security. This envisioned approach (see Figure 1) harnesses the natural language understanding (NLU) and generation abilities of pre-trained GPT models. It augments the assessment with organization-specific context developed by understanding the enterprise's security policies, guidelines, and checklists. This illustration shows the reference architecture for GenAI-enabled security assessments. The graphic includes six main blocks which include organizational context with security policies, guidelines, and checklists, application context with application architecture, threat model and functional overview, data processing with vector database, Azure search and GPT vision, generative AI security assessor with large language models, prompt engineering, grounding and few-shot learning, user interaction with compliance-related questions, user response and assessment report; governance with AI content safety, defender for cloud, Entra ID, application insights, purview, and Azure monitor. Reference architecture for GenAI-enabled security assessments This methodology empowers GenAI to apply security assessment solutions and evaluate application security, efficiently overcoming application challenges and guiding users toward human security experts based on risk levels and complexity. This transition to a human security expert is seamless, providing comprehensive security review summaries and personalized recommendations. The Statista study cited above states that the application security market is projected to generate $7.40 billion by 2024, with an expected annual growth rate of 12.89% (CAGR 2024-2029), resulting in a market volume of $13.57 billion by 2029. GenAI can create assessment summaries based on user response and security evaluation. Through skillful prompt design, GenAI can assess user responses, conduct a comprehensive security evaluation and present the inspection summary in a predefined format. It then generates tailored recommendations across categories, assisting the user in achieving optimal security for their application. This assessment determines the user's intent by collating relevant information from an application's code, configuration files, and architecture through a well-structured series of questions. Application complexity and security compliance rating are determined based on set parameters and guidelines, provided information about the application, and the responses given by the user.

Table 1 is a proposed sample output from a GenAI-led application assessment. The future of security assessments is poised for a significant transformation with the integration of GenAI. By leveraging advanced natural language understanding (NLU) and processing capabilities, GenAI can revolutionize how security assessments are conducted. It can automate vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, and personalized recommendations, addressing the complexities and challenges of modern IT applications while ensuring continuous improvement in security measures. Organizations adopting Generative AI can expect more efficient, comprehensive, and proactive security assessments, ultimately enhancing their overall security posture and resilience against evolving cyber threats.

In the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector, artificial intelligence (AI) has unlocked new opportunities and innovations. BFSI firms have been quick to take advantage, leveraging AI to tap into rich data and extract actionable insights. In addition, the industry has traditionally deployed AI backed virtual assistants or chatbots in various areas such as customer support, risk assessment, financial advisory, and fraud detection and more, for over a decade. Going forward, the adoption of AI is set to increase, and initiatives will predominantly focus on innovation and revenue. According to the BFSI industry report of the TCS AI for Business Study, 88% of Pacesetters (those organizations in the survey with stronger overall financial performance) are primarily focused on using AI for innovation and revenue growth. The study also revealed that 61% have AI implementations in-process or completed while 35% are planning AI projects. Unsurprisingly, firms are well aware of the need to ensure trustworthy AI outcomes which will necessitate strong governance processes—79% of BFSI firms are already reworking or planning to rework how they operate across the enterprise. BFSI firms are now turning to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the next evolution in AI, which has tremendous potential for disruptive transformation across various functions like risk management, fraud detection, financial advisory, underwriting, claims processing, financial contracts analysis, personal financial management, portfolio assistance, among others. GenAI backed by large language models (LLMs) can analyze data and provide crucial business and operational intelligence to improve decision-making and help BFSI firms effectively handle their complex operations. The demand for efficient GenAI tools and platforms is therefore increasing rapidly—our study revealed that 55% of BFSI firms plan to create enterprise-specific LLMs for GenAI implementations. While BFSI firms are optimistic about GenAI, challenges abound around data inaccuracies, fair and ethical use, transparency, trustworthiness, and hallucinations in the use of LLMs. Moreover, there are concerns around privacy and security and inadequate control over LLM responses. In addition, GenAI models will also increase the demand for compute resources. However, use of GenAI models is increasing in the BFSI industry and it is imperative to establish a safe and secure framework for implementing it. Several challenges will need to be overcome before BFSI firms can embark on building GenAI models. According to our study, a substantial 55% of BFSI firms plan to build enterprise-specific LLMs for GenAI implementations. We believe that GenAI can be leveraged to design several innovative offerings across the BFSI value chain. This will require BFSI organizations to define a systematic strategy for GenAI adoption and contextualize LLMs to enhance efficiency and drive significant business outcomes. As part of GenAI strategy definition, BFSI firms must traverse the following steps. In our view, BFSI firms can adopt one of three approaches to customize or contextualize existing, pre-trained LLMs to develop applications for specific use cases. Figure 1 depicts the three approaches as well as the use cases for which the approaches can be leveraged. A graphic showing the three approaches—prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuning—that BFSI firms can use to contextualize LLMs and design applications for key use cases. The use cases span text generation, translation, and classification, code generation, abstraction of information, and summary of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, among others. Prompt engineering This approach envisages leveraging pre-trained LLMs through an application programming interface (API) framework. As a result, it reduces capital expenditure by eliminating costly and time-consuming data collection, in turn speeding up project timelines and maximizing return on investment (RoI) while minimizing delays and budget overruns. Specific instructions are given to the existing LLM model to customize responses, reduce bias, and enhance performance, especially for tasks spanning areas such as summarization of financial reports, translation of legal documents, risk assessment, customer service, due diligence processes, and internal support. However, there is scope for hallucinated responses that may have adverse implications for financial decisions. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) In this approach, in addition to training data, a well-established, reliable data source, which may include domain-specific knowledge bases or the organizational database, is used to deliver LLM output that is accurate, relevant, and aligns with user queries. Vector databases are used to ensure efficient data handling. It significantly reduces infrastructure costs and deployment times, enables scalability in searching and retrieving information from heterogeneous elements such as financial transactions, stock trading, legal contracts, macro-economic developments, among others to benefit functions like investment advisory, claims management, underwriting, and portfolio advisory. However, multiple references in the sourced content can result in inaccurate or incomplete responses from the LLM model. Fine-tuning This approach leverages balanced, domain-specific data to specialize pre-trained, generic LLMs, adapting them to new tasks in specialized domains such as legal, finance, personal financial management, and so on. This approach is especially suitable for the BFSI sector given the twin needs of higher accuracy and to adapt the model to specific segments in alignment with the requirements of individual firms. Moreover, firms can create multiple contextual models to address a variety of business requirements—infrastructure can be reused, optimizing costs for hosting each model. However, fine-tuning requires huge amounts of diverse, high-quality data and significant computational power. The model can be further improved by constantly recalibrating it in response to human feedback and adapting it to changing business requirements. While this will boost reliability and user satisfaction, it can be cost-intensive and complex. In our view, BFSI firms must adopt a combination of RAG and fine-tuning (bolstered by human feedback) approaches to contextualize LLMs. Though the final choice will largely depend on organization specific requirements and business strategy, a model built using a hybrid approach of RAG and fine-tuning is preferable for BFSI firms as it enhances the ability to understand technology and nuances related with specific domains. Successful execution of GenAI projects will demand in depth knowledge of the BFSI domain, technology expertise, robust partnerships with cloud and technology providers, and experience in managing large transformation programs. TCS has entered into alliances with several AI leaders to offer best-in-class services to support GenAI adoption at scale, create  enterprise-centric models, establish responsible AI frameworks, and manage complex data sets (see Figure 2). A graphic showing TCS’ capabilities, expertise, and partnerships that can help BFSI firms develop GenAI-backed applications. TCS brings to the table a significant number of BFSI specific GenAI and AI solutions, BFSI-centric ML and LLM models, robust partnerships with hyperscalers, and a vast pool of professionals trained in GenAI. In addition, TCS has set up dedicated labs with GPUs and GenAI frameworks as well as domain-centric centers of excellence to support BFSI clients. Adopting GenAI is crucial for BFSI firms to gain the operational and business intelligence necessary for strategic decisions, innovation, and creation of new value. Unarguably, GenAI will help banks and insurers position themselves at the forefront of innovation and maximize growth. Going forward, GenAI will play a crucial role in the BFSI industry—the opportunities for transformative impact are tremendous. We believe that BFSI firms must look at GenAI adoption from a transformational lens and move beyond using it to develop point solutions for specific use cases. And needless to say, firms that leverage GenAI to innovate and rethink the way they operate will realize big wins.

Generative artificial intelligence or GenAI has caught the attention of business leaders in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) industry like no other technology has. Many firms are looking at adopting GenAI in business-as-usual operations—a recent TCS AI for Business Study revealed that 43% of BFSI firms expect more than half their employees to be using GenAI on a daily basis within the next three years. Given its potential to drive innovation, enhance customer experience, and transform business models across the BFSI value chain, the business case for GenAI adoption is unquestionable. However, the journey is not without pitfalls—ensuring ethical and responsible AI use without biases and hallucinations creeping in can be an uphill task; similarly, safeguarding sensitive customer data will mandate stringent guardrails. IT infrastructure, talent, and organizational culture are other aspects that can pose obstacles. Likewise, GenAI feeds on data, and ensuring seamless access to quality data can be a big challenge. The good news is that BFSI firms need not go it alone. The right partner with in depth knowledge of the BFSI sector, access to advanced technologies, and wide-ranging implementation expertise can make for smooth execution, in turn delivering quick wins. Going forward, we believe that GenAI will become central to the BFSI industry, especially in propelling innovation, enhancing knowledge- or data-driven decision-making, and growing revenue. Done right, GenAI has the potential to radically change the way BFSI firms do business. Given GenAI’s potential to add complementary value, it will become mainstream in the BFSI industry.

Sustainable procurement refers to making purchasing decisions that fulfill an organization's need for goods and services while minimizing environmental harm. In recent years, this approach has shifted from a desirable option to an essential one. It now plays a critical role in maintaining compliance and improving the organization's reputation and appeal to existing and potential customers. As companies pursue their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets, GenAI is rising as a powerful tool for change. It aids businesses in refining their procurement strategies, spurring innovation, and maintaining compliance with sustainable practices. Many chief procurement officers (CPOs) remain cautious about the potential of GenAI, viewing it as still years away from driving substantial business value. Their concerns center on the accuracy and security of the large language models (LLM) that form its foundation. Despite these reservations, GenAI is already demonstrating a tangible impact in the four critical areas below: GenAI, a subset of AI that can create new content and solutions, is uniquely positioned to address the complexities of sustainable procurement. This blog focuses on how GenAI can transform sustainable procurement in the following seven ways: As we work towards a sustainable future, transforming procurement practices is a necessity and a strategic advantage. By embedding sustainability at the core of procurement decisions, organizations can generate significant environmental, social, and economic benefits that align with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This transformation paves the way for reducing carbon emissions, cultivating ethical supply chains, and positioning businesses as key drivers of global progress.

The sales and marketing function faces numerous challenges, as customer demands evolve and new channels continue to emerge and mature. In the current landscape, companies must be adept at providing hyper-personalized content, accommodating dynamic user journeys, automating lead generation, converting sales without the help of sales representatives, effectively using influencer marketing, taking advantage of digital video and audio, and optimizing the use of search engines. At the same time, they must continually focus on engaging customers and enhancing their experience across the end-to-end customer journey—from initial awareness of a product or service and consideration to purchase, sale, post-sales service, and customer advocacy—keeping the customer front and center in the process. Generative AI (GenAI) can play a vital role in helping companies understand and actively address these challenges to cultivate long-term customers and achieve sustainable growth. The technology can serve as an intelligent assistant to every persona across the customer journey, enabling use cases that enhance the quality and speed of customer engagement at critical customer touchpoints. For example, digital marketing specialists can use GenAI to plan and execute more effective marketing campaigns, while content creators can leverage GenAI to create and distribute more engaging content. In fact, GenAI is poised to transform how every sales and marketing role operates and the value each role delivers. Let’s, for instance, consider the technology’s impact on one role: the frontline sales representatives (sales reps) responsible for online and physical stores. GenAI can provide assistance and insights, automate currently manual and tedious activities, and empower reps with the information needed to more effectively engage with and convert customers. An enterprise-wise approach to GenAI-led transformation covering three phases—assist, augment, and transform—can help with seamless adoption and make the technology more effective for organizations. The approach starts with the assist phase, where GenAI is used to boost human capability. For example, it can execute a knowledge search across many different data sources to help customers and agents in their daily activities. The GenAI capabilities used can include the following: The next phase is augment, where humans and machines collaborate to achieve better outcomes. In sales and marketing, this collaboration focuses on two key areas: For example, GenAI can be used to provide recommendations to improve search engine rankings and can serve as a customer lifetime value advisor by analyzing customer data and producing recommended actions to maximize long-term value for customers. Finally, in the transform phase, AI leverages its inherent creative abilities to elevate human capabilities, helping reimagine value chains and processes and develop innovative solutions. For example, by analyzing customer review comments, GenAI can suggest product features that will not only help improve current customer satisfaction levels but also help with new product discovery to improve sales and revenue. An illustration of a phased approach to AI-enabled sales and marketing transformation. Covering three stages—assist, augment, transform—the approach can help organizations effectively use AI for sales and marketing transformation. In the assist phase, AI boosts human capability. For example, executing a knowledge search across many different data sources to help customers and agents in their daily activities. In the augment phase, humans and machines collaborate to achieve better outcomes, focusing on activity optimization and experience play. Finally, in the transform phase, AI elevates human capabilities, helping reimagine value chains and processes and develop innovative solutions. A valuable complement to the three-phase AI implementation approach is a four-layer architecture for GenAI transformation. As illustrated in Figure 2, this architecture provides a comprehensive framework for integrating AI into sales and marketing. The foundation lies in robust data management—built on top of core enterprise information and operations technology systems—that encompasses structured, unstructured, and external data sources, along with data lakes and warehouses. This data fuels the foundational large language models (LLMs), including those for text, images, and video, and enables advanced analytics. An illustration of a four-layer AI architecture comprising a core enterprise IT and OT layer; a foundational layer of large language models (LLMs), data warehouses, and data lakes enabling advanced analytics; purposive and contextual task agents powered by GenAI; and AI-augmented work systems. With this architecture as the foundation, companies can develop and implement a wide range of solutions that help transform the sales and marketing function. The architecture's strength lies in its purposive and contextual GenAI-powered task agents, which are built on the underpinning information stores from the data lakes and data marts. Human oversight and controls ensure ethical and responsible AI implementation, with guardrails and observability mechanisms in place. These agents serve as specific assistants to each of the personas in the ecosystem—such as consumer review insights board, next-best actions sales advisor, and assistants for consumers, agents, and data analysts—thereby enabling AI-augmented work systems that help drive intelligent, informed decisions for every customer scenario. This four-layer architecture offers a robust solution for building complex GenAI applications, providing a modular framework that enhances maintainability and efficiency and allows developers to fully leverage GenAI’s power. The architecture delivers three key benefits: With this architecture as the foundation, companies can deploy GenAI to a wide range of use cases, helping transform the sales and marketing function to deliver critical business outcomes. Use cases can fall into three broad categories: Intelligent sales assistance, intelligent marketing assistance, and sales and marketing analytics and insights. 1. Intelligent marketing assistance: This predominantly focuses on assisting, augmenting, and enhancing the quality, productivity, and speed of marketing content creators. It includes: Product catalog assist Product content assist SEO content advisor 2. Intelligent sales assistance: This primarily focuses on enabling the sales representative (online or in-store) with information and recommendations that will facilitate an effective sale and create value for the customer and the business. It includes: Next best actions sales advisor Consumer and agent assist Customer lifetime value advisor 3. Sales and marketing analytics and insights: Companies can use AI to tailor analytics and insights to different perspectives. For example, AI can synthesize customer review comments and feedback for each persona in the ecosystem, interpreting reviews consistently across the value chain and providing competition analysis to help not just win customers, but also retain them for life. Use cases include: Consumer review insights Enterprise data insights Legal contracts advisor Agent performance advisor Sales and marketing predictive analytics One example of how AI can improve sales and marketing is that of a global manufacturer, which deployed AI to help streamline content generation. Before GenAI: Employees across various departments manually managed tasks, such as generating content​, rephrasing content, translating languages​, correcting spelling and grammar, summarizing documents​, and analyzing data. After GenAI: The company deploys an enterprise chatbot solution leveraging Google's PaLM 2 chat-bison model to enhance employee productivity.​ For example, via natural language queries, employees can interact with the chatbot and receive relevant and informative responses from the foundation model. The chatbot maintains the context of ongoing conversations, ensuring coherent and meaningful interactions.​ The sales and marketing landscape is constantly evolving, making it difficult for businesses to keep pace with the changing market landscape. It’s especially challenging given the significant influence of factors external to the enterprise—primarily, the market and all the dimensions that shape it. GenAI is a powerful tool that can help businesses navigate these complexities to achieve sustainable growth. The technology is poised to revolutionize sales and marketing by automating tasks, personalizing customer experiences, and providing data-driven insights for decision making among sales agents, marketing content generators, and service agents who can tailor content and interactions for each individual customer or prospect. This will boost engagement, sales, and long-term loyalty that drives sustainable revenue growth. Companies should act now to lead with AI.

Industries and business functions have jumped onto the GenAI bandwagon and are actively looking for use cases where this magic wand can be waved. For IT, the high-value use cases are clearly in the areas of code generation, synthetic data, and the creation of artifacts such as test cases and scripts. Predictions from Gartner® for the future of GenAI use in their study mentions “By 2027, nearly 15% of new applications will be automatically generated by AI without a human in the loop. This is not happening at all today.” Ready to use: The lure of GenAI is that their solutions are like fast food - they come with various tasks that can be consumed straight out of the box. Leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in the realm of code generation, GenAl offers a seamless experience, with hyperscalers wrapping cloud solutions around them. These LLMs, trained on vast source code, can swiftly generate software based on plain English prompts. This approach radically differs from traditional code generation methods, which require intensive pre-processing efforts. These new entrants disrupt the LCNCIDT (low code no code and intelligent developer tools) market as GenAl initially manifests itself as intelligent assistants or copilots, enhancing the developer experience. Re-imagined user interfaces: Machines now comprehend human languages, marking a significant advancement from developers learning low-level to high-level languages for computer interaction. Future conversations may shift to voice-based, more human-like interactions with versatile user interfaces, altering development approaches. The future UI will be primarily chat-based, as end-users will no longer want to learn how to use a brand-new software interface when they can communicate with it like a regular person. Today, developers utilize various integrated development environments (IDEs) for coding in languages such as Java, .NET, and Python alongside multiple tools for testing, packaging, and deploying applications, with chat-based interfaces augmenting SDLC touchpoints. Low-code platforms should, therefore, stay ahead of the curve in driving these innovations in the way tomorrow's applications are created and consumed. Empowerment: The biggest excitement around GenAI stems from the fact that it puts the power to create into the hands of the users. The grail is for citizen developers to be able to develop complete working applications and host them independently. Creativity: Traditionally, good, old-fashioned AI (GOFAI) and ML techniques were good at classification (sorting) and regression (making connections). With GenAI,they have started generation (text, sound, images, and video). This is a paradigm shift, even for many AI experts who had maintained that creativity would be the final frontier for AI until recently. GenAI is already being applied to generating and aiding designs in the automobile, manufacturing, and healthcare industries. It is expected that nearly 60% of design efforts for building new websites and mobile apps can be performed by GenAI. The key role of GenAI in application and test case design would be to quickly generate multiple options during the ideation process to assist the designer. GenAI implications Some of the capabilities that are being explored include: While GenAl holds promising potential, it poses evolving risks such as factual inaccuracies, biases, and security concerns. With AI-generated code, quality may suffer, which in turn leads to increased technical debt. Service providers address these issues with citations and contextualization. Implementing GenAl responsibly in enterprises requires pragmatic approaches and guardrails. LCNC platforms can leverage traditional code generation practices and GenAl models to ensure usability, correctness, security, performance, maintainability, and compliance. Key strategies include facilitating access to pre-trained LLMs, integrating open-source models like Hugging Face, and enhancing results through fine-tuning, retrieval augmented generation technique (RAG), and knowledge integration.

In the highly commoditized financial services industry, service quality differentiates a financial institution from the pack of organizations competing for the custom of the same set of customers. Service quality has a direct impact on customer satisfaction and retention. Outstanding service helps nurture long-term relationships, drives repeat business, and elevates the bank’s brand. Positive experiences lead to word-of-mouth referrals, expanding the client base, and solidifying market position. Financial institutions utilize various channels to deliver customer service, including digital self-service and human-managed platforms such as contact centers and live chats. Customers have adopted digital banking channels at a rapid pace, but the volume of interactions handled by contact centers continues to increase annually. This trend has led to elevated operational costs and diminished customer satisfaction. In our view, the quality of service must be so high as to eliminate the need for customer support services—customers must be able to seamlessly meet all their banking needs without having to connect with a contact center agent. The efficiency of contact centers is largely contingent upon the quality of agents handling calls and the underlying technology utilized for call management. To ensure successful problem-solving, it is crucial to accurately identify the issues that require attention and implement appropriate process improvements and technological interventions. Financial institutions frequently invest in digital channels, often failing to take a comprehensive approach to improving customer service and addressing issues in entirety. In our view, the way forward lies in adopting a solution backed by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). GenAI has the potential to revolutionize customer support services by enabling a shift to proactive support through better self-service channels. In combination with advanced data analysis, predictive modelling, and real-time monitoring, GenAI can anticipate customer needs and offer personalized solutions, reducing the need for support services, in turn boosting service efficiency and customer satisfaction. The need for customer support should be an exception rather than the norm. In our view, financial institutions must initiate change across the four dimensions of infrastructure and processes, the way support is offered, self-service digital channels, and contact center operations to enhance the quality of service and reduce the need for support. Customers typically seek assistance when their expectations have not been met. For instance, issues such as delayed payments, unrecognized charges in statements, or errors during mobile app login can prompt customers to contact customer support centers. Most of the issues that trigger a request for support are recurring in nature. By identifying and addressing the underlying causes of these issues, financial institutions can eliminate the need for customers to seek help. GenAI can be leveraged to analyze extensive datasets to identify patterns in customer issues. By examining customer interactions, transaction histories, and feedback, GenAI can accurately detect common pain points and the underlying causes of recurring problems that trigger support requests. Armed with these insights, banks can initiate specific measures to permanently eliminate the root cause of such recurring problems (see Figure 1). A graphic showing how GenAI will help reduce customer complaints and the need for support services. GenAI technology will help banks analyze huge amounts of data spanning call transcripts, transaction histories, and feedback to identify patterns in service issues and pinpoint the root cause of recurring issues that force customers to reach out to the contact center for support. With these insights, banks can initiate action to eliminate the causes problems for customers and trigger calls to the contact center. In our experience, such measures span streamlining systems and processes, improving workflows, increasing transparency, and enhancing user interfaces, among others. With GenAI, banks can share additional information about transactions and associated charges, provide a mechanism for customers to track their transactions in real-time, and send notifications on delayed payments—all of this will greatly reduce the need for customers to reach out for support services. The prevailing model in financial institutions necessitates that customers contact the helpdesk when they experience issues or require assistance, despite the fact that the triggers for these calls frequently exist within the institution's systems. This reactive approach implies that even when data suggests potential problems—such as atypical account activity, transaction failures, online or mobile login issues, and unexpected charges—the responsibility to initiate contact remains with the customer. Integrating event-based triggers using predictive and GenAI can help financial institutions to identify specifics events which can cause distress to customers. Predictive AI analyzes these triggers to assess the likelihood of customers reaching out for support, enabling the institution to proactively anticipate and resolve issues (see Figure 2). GenAI can be used to develop a personalized solution based on the customer's profile and history in combination with standard operating procedures (SOPs). A graphic showing the existing support model in contact centers and the shift that banks can make by using GenAI. Customers call the contact center for support when they face issues. However, the issues that trigger support requests are often part of banks’ systems—regardless of this, the onus is on customers to reach out to the contact center. By leveraging a combination of predictive AI and GenAI, banks can identify events that can result in a request for support and tailor a solution to address the issue. This will enable a shift from a reactive support model to a proactive one, where banks anticipate and resolve issues even before customers initiate a request for support. Despite the availability of online channels, many customers reach out to contact centers for support. This underutilization of digital platforms can be attributed to several factors including a lack of awareness about app features and the complexity of digital tools. Additionally, digital channels can be particularly challenging for older, less tech-savvy customers, who often prefer traditional communication methods. Furthermore, rule-based chat agents are limited in handling nuanced queries, which can frustrate users and drive them back to human-assisted channels (see Figure 3). These factors collectively hinder the adoption of digital channels, impeding efficient customer service in financial institutions. A graphic showing the limitations of chat agents that result in below par service. Customers connect with contact centers for support even though there are a plethora of online channels and digital platforms. This happens because customers are often unaware of the features of banking apps or find digital channels difficult to navigate or prefer human communication. Additionally, rule-based chat agents have limited capabilities and are not able to handle nuanced queries which compel customers to opt for human-assisted channels. A combination of all these factors deter customers from switching to digital channels, in turn adversely affecting efficient customer service delivery in the financial services industry. With GenAI, banks can tailor interactions to cater to the needs of individual customers. Utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, GenAI can transform chat agents into sophisticated virtual assistants that converse like humans and understand emotions, delivering personalized solutions, thereby reducing the need for contact with human agents (see Figure 4). Furthermore, integrating GenAI-backed chat functions into popular messaging platforms such as WhatsApp can increase adoption rates, as customers prefer familiar and convenient channels. This approach improves customer satisfaction and experience, reducing the volume of calls to contact centers. A graphic showing the enhanced capabilities that GenAI backed chat agents bring to the table. These chat agents can talk with customers like human beings, recognize emotions, and deliver personalized solutions to fulfill their specific needs. They can manage information and transaction requests that demand reason and judgment and are equipped with the ability to handle diverse types of customer requests. This in turn mitigates the need for support from human agents and reduces the volume of calls to contact centers. Financial services contact centers encounter numerous challenges that impact both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency (see Table 1). These challenges underscore the urgent need for contact centers to adopt more advanced technologies, enhance training programs, and implement robust quality assurance measures to improve the overall quality of support. A comprehensive transformation approach will streamline operations by reducing average handling time (AHT) and increasing first contact resolution (FCR). Challenge Solution Prolonged wait times leading to customer frustration and dissatisfaction. Advanced predictive AI to foresee the reasons for customer calls—agents gain a comprehensive view of recent customer interactions across various channels, allowing them to review customers’ attempts to resolve issues prior to calling the contact center. Low first call resolution requiring customers to make multiple calls. GenAI-powered agent to offer recommendations and prescribe solutions based on SOPs and successful solutions used to resolve similar issues in the past. Poor customers experience due to lack of personalization and empathy in interactions. Real-time quality monitoring to track call etiquette, conversation speed, and empathy levels; a dynamic customer sentiment meter to evaluate customer's emotional state in real-time. Inconsistent agent performance due to insufficient training and lack of tools to address complex scenario. Access to detailed customer persona information and call transcripts, supported by a GenAI-powered co-pilot, to retrieve relevant data based on customer inquiries, suggest optimal actions, and offer prescriptive solutions. Inaccurate post call updates spanning summarizing on-call discussions, classification based on intent, and maintaining a record of complaints among others. GenAI to automatically document information received from the customer into CRM systems, summarize the call, tag the reason that triggered the call, and create complaint records, as appropriate. Table 1: Challenges encountered by bank contact centers and recommended solutions While the benefits of GenAI adoption in financial services are undeniable, there are challenges as well—the BFSI industry report of the recent TCS AI for Business study revealed that ethical and responsible AI use is a top concern for GenAI adoption in financial services. Financial institutions must err on the side of caution—they must continuously monitor and refine AI models, ensure compliance with regulatory standards, and maintain transparent communication with customers regarding AI usage. In addition, financial institutions must establish adequate ethical guardrails to address issues related with biases and hallucinations. Data privacy and security too will need attention in the form of role based access controls. Contact centers monitor the quality of calls to enhance performance, improve customer satisfaction, identify the reasons for poor quality, and initiate remedial measures. However, existing practices used to monitor call quality are often inadequate and inefficient. A small sample of calls—approximately 3-5%— are manually reviewed while the remaining 95-97% go unchecked. Such selective monitoring leads to missed opportunities to identify and rectify performance issues. Consequently, banks are not able to enhance the quality of agent performance and effectiveness of the contact center. The existing monitoring process requires listening to entire calls to evaluate their quality, making it both time-consuming and costly. This not only increases operational expenses but also limits the scalability of quality monitoring efforts. As a result, numerous valuable insights and potential areas for improvement remain undiscovered, preventing the contact center from achieving optimal performance and consistently delivering high-quality customer support. Achieving 100% call quality monitoring has thus far remained an aspirational goal for banks—but the advent of GenAI has changed this. GenAI  has the capability to monitor each and every call rather than just a small sample, and in turn revolutionize the functioning of contact centers and the quality of support delivered This comprehensive monitoring allows identification of quality issues across all interactions, providing a complete picture of agent performance and customer experience. GenAI can automatically transcribe and analyze calls in real-time, detect nuances in tone and sentiment, as well as monitor compliance with regulatory requirements. With end-to-end monitoring, contact centers can identify specific areas requiring improvement such as communication,  adherence with protocols. Steps can then be taken to promptly address issues, optimize training programs, and enhance overall support quality. Additionally, it systematically documents interactions, thereby reducing the risk of non-compliance and associated penalties. This holistic approach not only improves operational efficiency but also elevates the standard of service, fostering greater customer satisfaction and trust. The next-generation GenAI-driven contact center represents a significant advancement in customer support. To maximize the benefits of GenAI in customer support services, financial institutions should adopt a strategic approach involving comprehensive needs assessment, investments in GenAI technologies, and strong data management practices.

The transition toward electric vehicles, software-defined vehicles (SDVs), and autonomous-driving capabilities is changing the way automakers market their products. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds the potential to revolutionize automotive marketing by bringing in hyper-personalization and creative engagement strategies to attract the customer. That is a critical shift from traditional AI, which focuses mostly on data analysis and automation. By leveraging GenAI, OEMs can transform customer experience to outperform their peers in an increasingly competitive and dynamic market landscape. It is no longer about just collecting information in the GenAI era. It is about transforming that data into personalized narratives that speak directly to individual consumers and resonate with them at a deeper level. By analyzing vast amounts of data, which include browsing history, purchase patterns, and social media activity, GenAI can create dynamic customer profiles that will drive highly targeted marketing efforts. This approach enables brands to deliver content that will be highly relevant to a customer. GenAI transforms vast data sets into personalized narratives that resonate with individual consumers, driving highly targeted and relevant marketing efforts. The technology can provide carmakers unparalleled insights into their customer base. Modern vehicles are often described as ‘software on wheels,’ driven by millions of lines of codes and aided with sensors. Those sensors provide information on how customers use their vehicles and what might be the value-added services they seek. For example, an automaker is launching a new line of electric vehicles (EV), targeted at environmentally conscious urban professionals. GenAI allows the brand to create a personalized marketing campaign for a potential customer, who frequently engages with sustainability content online and drives a small, aging hybrid car. Since the customer is interested in reducing his carbon footprint, GenAI crafts a personalized advertisement showcasing the new EV's environmental benefits, such as its zero-emissions features and the availability of green charging stations near his home. This advertisement does not just provide information, but also resonates with the buyer’s values and lifestyle. There are, of course, concerns around data privacy and industry regulations, while managing large-scale operations, that need to be addressed when implementing data-driven personalization. Through avatar-based personalization, GenAI offers immersive, interactive experiences that strengthen the relationship between consumers and automotive brands. By allowing users to see the digital representations of themselves interacting with a vehicle, GenAI offers a deeply immersive and engaging experience. Avatar-based personalization also moves beyond traditional ads, providing a memorable interaction that strengthens the connection between the consumer and the brand. As GenAI continues to evolve, integration with augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the internet of things (IoT) will only expand the possibilities for avatar-based personalization, offering even more sophisticated and engaging consumer experiences. For example, GenAI will allow a customer to create a digital avatar of himself that mirrors his appearance and lifestyle. He sees his avatar driving a new EV through a virtual cityscape that mirrors his urban environment. The avatar navigates typical city traffic, showcasing the vehicle’s regenerative braking and energy-saving features. This experience not only highlights the car’s capabilities but also helps the customer visualize how the EV could seamlessly integrate into his daily life. The advertisement can end with a call to action to book a test drive at the nearest dealer point at the earliest available date for the customer. But again, to develop this level of avatar-based personalization requires significant technological investment and careful attention to privacy and data security. Predictive analytics enables automotive brands to anticipate trends and personalize the entire customer journey, ensuring marketing strategies remain relevant and impactful. GenAI can help automotive brands anticipate and respond to market trends. By analyzing emerging consumer behaviors and preferences, it can help brands stay ahead of the curve. That also enhances customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. For a buyer who purchases an EV, GenAI uses predictive analytics to anticipate his next steps. Recognizing a growing trend in eco-friendly vehicle purchases among urban professionals, a GenAI-based system will suggest tailored financing options that emphasize long-term savings on fuel and maintenance. Additionally, it could propose to the customer personalized service plans that offer home installation of a charging station, ensuring a seamless transition to EV ownership. A point worth noting here is that predictive models must be continuously updated with fresh data to ensure their accuracy, and integrating these insights into broader marketing strategies requires coordination across various functions. While these opportunities are exciting, automakers must tackle the challenges that lie along the way. For a start, implementing innovative technology requires substantial investment and the integration of GenAI with existing systems can be complex and resource intensive. As stricter regulations on GenAI come into effect globally, companies will have to comply with robust data privacy and security laws to meet regulatory requirements while also managing large scale data operations. Creating avatar-based personalizations can be capex intensive for many companies and predictive models must be continuously trained with fresh data to maintain output accuracy. By navigating these challenges with careful planning and a focus on innovation, automakers can leverage GenAI to build stronger connections with their customers, drive engagement, and position themselves at the forefront in the industry. The future is not just about adapting to change but about shaping it—and GenAI offers the tools to do just that.

A digital thread establishes digital continuity across the enterprise value chain, helping overcome process and system disconnects. Manufacturing companies are battling multiple challenges—new business models, the pressure to deliver sustainable solutions and outstanding customer experiences, evolving ecosystems, and increased product complexities. They are struggling to quickly roll out products, be more responsive to change, control costs, and improve productivity and operational excellence. Overcoming these challenges will require them to simplify and integrate their disconnected business processes and systems and accelerate their digital transformation. Building a digital thread to establish digital continuity across the enterprise value chain can minimize the process disconnects and bring traceability to product data and processes. This will give companies control and enable a seamless flow of contextual product data required to make timely and informed decisions. Digital threads are the data foundations that power digital twins and are continuously updated with insights and recommendations from these twins. They are characterized by four key behaviors: When combined with knowledge graphs and generative AI (GenAI), the business transformative potential of a digital thread goes up exponentially. Together, they allow unprecedented levels of data discovery on vast amounts of data to generate intelligence and new contexts. This approach is perfect for handling product life cycle data. A key challenge that the industry has been grappling with is modeling product life cycle data using industry-standard ontologies and trying to achieve seamless interoperability between different stakeholders who work on diversified systems. The diverse nature of data and data formats makes the task daunting. Knowledge graphs are well-suited to modeling and delivering a highly networked web of data. This makes them a perfect complement to digital threads, which can be visualized as a web of complex, diversified product artifacts and data covering the entire life cycle of a product. Together, they can help companies unlock greater value from product life cycle data, better visualize traceability across the end-to-end product life cycle, and drive their product life cycle strategies. They can: There are many exciting real-world applications for various stakeholders in product development. Different personas involved in product development need different contexts of product life cycle data for their day-to-day decision making. With a knowledge graph implemented on top of an enterprise digital thread and used as a platform for running AI and GenAI algorithms, persona-based views can be easily generated for various business contexts. For instance: Knowledge graphs, digital threads, and most recently GenAI have gained traction in the industry and are increasingly being used to build scalable, intelligent, and interoperable solutions. To fully exploit the combined potential of knowledge graphs, digital thread, and GenAI, enterprises need a resilient, scalable, and interoperable architecture. Such an architecture can help deliver innovative solutions to address data complexities, allow better visualization, and enable intelligent analytics. We envision a multitier architecture integrated with enterprise systems and comprising five key layers: The image envisions an architecture for knowledge graphs, digital thread, and GenAI that is integrated with enterprise systems and comprising five integrated layers. Such a scalable and resilient architecture can help companies extract and prepare a complete product data network, which can be harnessed for key business decisions. The power of three—knowledge graphs, digital thread, and GenAI—can be effectively used to reimagine problem-solving in product development. It can be applied across industries, as shown by the high-impact, cross-industry use cases below: Digital threads, knowledge graphs, and GenAI can unearth impactful data points entangled in complex product data networks and unlock exponential value for companies. Working in concert, they can boost productivity and responsiveness for companies. They can help enterprises make informed decisions, deliver cost-effective products, minimize asset downtime, or create sustainable, innovative designs that reduce friction in the customer value chain. Indeed, the opportunities for transformation across the value chain are unprecedented. Those who move in early to capitalize on these opportunities and harness these powerful technologies to identify disconnects across the enterprise, navigate product data complexities, build traceable product life cycles, and rapidly generate intuitive designs are already on the path to greater success.

Quick decision-making and a broader view of data are critical to keep pace with the fast-changing wealth management industry. Access to actionable, data-driven business and operational intelligence in real time is critical for astute business decisions. Wealth managers and financial controllers need data on a host of things—the inflow and outflow of funds in specific periods, assets under management (AUM), income, expenses, client profitability, product pricing, relationship manager attrition, customer churn, campaign management, and regulatory capital requirements. Similarly, financial controllers, top management, and wealth managers require a transparent view of the performance of key products and services in order to identify the most promising offerings as well as those whose performance is subpar. Such comprehensive data will help wealth firms define measures to boost their growth. Wealth firms often struggle to make the right business decisions due to the lack of comprehensive and timely business intelligence, resulting in poor outcomes and dissatisfied customers. Gaining seamless access to data and then slicing and dicing it to generate reports for in-depth analysis require deep technical expertise. Business teams often lack the requisite technical skills to extract data spread across disparate databases, analyze it, and draw conclusions. While there are multiple self-service tools that can facilitate data extraction and analysis, to use them effectively, firms must equip teams with tool-specific technical skills or hire tech-savvy domain experts. Consequently, business leaders are often forced to reach out to IT teams to access relevant data. These teams assess the request, identify relevant datasets, create data extraction programs, and deliver the information through a report. However, the turnaround on such requests varies from a few days to several weeks, delaying strategic business decisions such as how to deal with under-performing offerings—whether to withdraw them from the market or tweak them to better meet customer requirements—among others. This, in turn, results in unfavorable business outcomes, including loss of revenue and customer churn. The solution lies in building the capability to handle queries in natural language. This will enable wealth management business teams to quickly access the required information and interact with databases in natural language, thereby eliminating the dependence on IT teams. Compared with the existing cumbersome process, this approach will significantly enhance user experience and data accessibility, making data exploration and analysis more user-friendly, even for non-technical users. Conversational SQL tools with the capability to handle natural language queries can be built by leveraging generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs). For example, with a GenAI tool, wealth firms can post a query in natural language to instantly ascertain which relationship managers have an AUM below a certain threshold in a specific period—this intelligence can form the basis of new strategies to grow AUM. Similarly, the tool can be used to gain insights on how products are performing in different markets. With such insights, firms can tweak existing offerings and design new offerings that better meet customer needs, resulting in new revenue streams. GenAI tools democratize access to knowledge and information, eliminating key person risk, enhancing information sharing across asset classes, facilitating easier access to documents and policies for support functions, and reducing time and cost spends on recreating old artefacts. GenAI promises a sea of potential, and more. Several functions such as investment research, portfolio management, hyper-personalized strategies, client reporting, regulatory compliance, financial advisory, cybersecurity, and risk management can benefit significantly. GenAI-enabled research assistants can be deployed, forming a low-cost, ‘artificial’ army of research analysts and investment consultants in the financial advisory space. This will allow human analysts to focus on niche sets of data and expedite the overall research operation. Similarly, customer due diligence systems can be improved by integrating a GenAI-based chatbot into know your customer (KYC) processing for initial screening and document verification. However, business leaders in wealth firms are treading cautiously: they are adopting GenAI for internal purposes before using it in customer-facing functions. GenAI can also help firms nimbly adapt to regulatory change. When the US announced stringent sanctions against Russia in response to the Ukraine conflict, restrictions were imposed on the international assets and remittances of Russian businessmen. Wealth firms had to comply with the sanctions while ensuring minimal negative impact on their business across the globe. This situation required well-coordinated, prompt action across various departments within firms. Large financial institutions and wealth firms scrambled to comply, setting up task forces to collect data, assess risk, and identify impacted client relationships. GenAI-driven self-analytical capabilities could have facilitated quicker turnaround in data analysis for such clients and helped relationship managers to proactively safeguard their business. UK regulators have mandated climate risk disclosures in line with the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. Compliance demands clear, comprehensive, high-quality information on the impacts of climate change, including risks and opportunities presented by rising temperatures, climate-related policy, and emerging technologies. Wealth firms had to review their engagements with clients and classify them into various climate change-related categories to comply with TCFD; for example, a customer in the mining sector is rated lower than one in the green energy area. Timely compliance became a challenge given the dependence on technical experts to extract relevant data for analysis and on functional experts to validate the extracted information. With the ability to learn from existing queries and generate data and reports in different formats, facilitate mining of information and in-depth analytics, GenAI can help address these challenges swiftly. Ensuring compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) becomes easier with GenAI tools. The tool can seamlessly integrate with reporting and internal audit systems and pull reports needed to verify that the compliance software is working as intended, thereby avoiding unforeseen issues. Generally, wealth managers query KPIs for business decisions and reporting. We propose a GenAI tool that leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand natural language queries on KPIs spanning total revenues, profit margin, gross sales for custody clients, and so on, and translate them into structured SQL commands that databases can process (see Figure 1). It can also perform tasks such as parsing, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis to accurately grasp user intent. Security concerns are addressed by applying role-based access controls using existing identity and access management (IAM) frameworks. A graphic showing the architecture of a GenAI tool for wealth managers to gain meaningful insights from data. Application-specific contextual data is enabled with a business data pipeline, an embedded model, and a vector database. A user query is orchestrated through a controller and also a context determinator interacting with the vector database, which converts the user query into an SQL query by adding business context. The SQL query is routed back through the context determinator, the controller, to a prompt generator, which is linked to large language models (LLMs) for SQL query generation. The query is fed into an application database that responds to the controller by enriching the LLM prompt with business data for further prompt generation to help prepare the final response with relevant business data, which is then sent to the user interface. The tool’s ability to learn and respond to the specific business context of the application is an important aspect. Financial institutions can consider two approaches to enable this contextual learning: In-context learning (ICL): ICL is a relatively easy and inexpensive approach to convert queries in natural language to SQL. The major benefit of ICL is that it avoids retraining of the LLM, which is a cost- and resource-intensive process, requiring huge sets of training data. The best part of this approach is that the model learns to formulate prompts from a very small set of contextual examples. Additionally, it is flexible, and can be done on the fly, based on the context. However, one challenge with this approach is that it is heavily dependent on the context which means that the prompt has to be extremely accurate to ensure high quality output. Fine-tuning LLMs: This involves retraining a pre-trained LLM for a specific domain or application, which requires a large, labelled dataset, avoiding the need to train a model from scratch. An existing LLM is trained by leveraging NLP to convert it into SQL pairs using the firm’s structured data. The success of the model is heavily dependent on the quality and coverage of the training data. However, producing comprehensive and error-free training data is difficult. In addition, retraining the model is costly and time-consuming, requiring additional computational resources beyond those needed to run the tool. Given the limitations of fine-tuning, we believe ICL offers an easier approach. By enabling the addition of contextual information extracted from a large number of historical queries received from business teams, financial controllers, and wealth managers, accurate prompts can be crafted. Chain-of-thought prompting can be used to train the model and guide its responses, resulting in precise and accurate data for business analytics. Credit Suisse, a UBS company, is running a proof of concept (PoC) to determine the feasibility of implementing a GenAI-powered conversational SQL tool. The tool is equipped with natural language capabilities to ease and speed up the process of accessing data for business decision-making. Given its favorable economics and superior results, we decided to adopt the ICL approach. The tool leveraged contextual business data such as KPIs, AUM, revenue, income, data dictionaries, schema mapping, among others, along with frequently used SQL queries to formulate the prompt. With this tool, Credit Suisse has already seen some early wins: In light of the prevailing geopolitical environment and the growing emphasis on sustainable return on investments, the demand for streamlined business decisions and prompt response is intense in the wealth management industry. GenAI can help accelerate decision-making and enhance productivity for wealth firms.

Abhilash Augustine Chief Architect, BFSI, TCS You have these already downloaded We have sent you a copy of the report to your email again. The core systems of all the major banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) companies will inherently have some legacy components written in old programming languages such as COBOL and Assembler. The components include complex mainframe-based applications that are exceptionally reliable. However, the cost involved in their maintenance and operations adds up to of a fortune. These legacy applications are also notorious for their lack of agility. It takes a lot of time and money for organizations to add new business capabilities to these systems, create better user journeys, or respond to regulatory mandates. Even though most of these enterprises desire to modernize their mainframe applications, the inherent complexities in reverse engineering and forward engineering the existing legacy applications pose a major hurdle. We believe GenAI can help. With the advent of newer versions of large language models (LLMs), increased context token size, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities, GenAI is well poised to help enterprises tackle the challenges in mainframe modernization programs. Traditionally, automated tools for application discovery have been devised to analyze the legacy estate and generate dependency reports and other insights. Moreover, there are a variety of code refactoring tools with various levels of automated code generation capabilities. But how GenAI-based tools are revolutionizing this area by providing high-quality output be it in business rules extraction (BRE) or target code generation with microservices architecture compatibility. For example, some of the newer GenAI based tools can analyze mainframe code and explain what it does in plain English and then generate corresponding Java code, enabling the same functionality with minimal inputs from the subject matter experts (SMEs). Once the BRE is done for a piece of legacy code, there is also the option of generating the target code based on those rules using GenAI tools like GitHub Copilot or Amazon CodeWhisperer. Initial pilots have demonstrated that the GenAI-generated code is of better quality and maintainability compared with traditional code refactoring approaches. This holds great promise as a modernization accelerator. Just like any other evolving technology, GenAI has its own challenges. Due to LLMs’ inherent nature of being non-deterministic, GenAI output can vary over time for the same input prompt. It can also hallucinate and generate non-relevant output as we have experienced with the likes of ChatGPT. Yet another challenge is the limited context tokens that can be accepted by the LLMs to create and maintain the context of the prompts. There is also another set of challenges from a regulatory standpoint around the explainability, traceability, ownership, and nonrepudiation aspects of the generated output. The newer versions of GenAI tools show a lot of promise in tackling the above-mentioned challenges by refining their architecture and by introducing innovative capabilities like RAG and multiple interpolation techniques. The RAG capability will help in reducing the effects of the LLMs hallucinations and non-deterministic behavior since it allows the GenAI solution architects to inject context to the GenAI tool. This can be achieved by vectorizing domain-related or context-setting data and feeding it to the GenAI solution to bind its output within the given context, resulting in a more accurate and relevant output that makes sense to the business area in question. To increase the context length, a myriad techniques are available, including neural tangent kernel (NTK) interpolation, position interpolation (PI), attention with linear biases (ALiBi), and rotational positional encoding (RoPE) among others. These approaches have the potential to increase the context length to two million tokens and beyond. Any increase in the context length will have positive impact on the quality of output of the GenAI tools and solutions. For example, consider using GenAI to extract business rules from legacy application code and with larger context length. A greater number of legacy code files can be ingested in a single go, thereby enabling it to generate well-rounded business rules for a particular code module. A modernization road map with a well-defined GenAI strategy using RAG capabilities will be pivotal in accelerating any large modernization programs within the BFSI landscape. It will increase the success rate of the mainframe optimization and modernization endeavours. With newer versions of LLMs and the faster rate of GenAI innovations, the future looks quite bright and promising for GenAI-enabled mainframe modernization initiatives. It would be advisable to start early experiments and pilots with the latest GenAI tools to understand their potential and experience their capabilities in accelerating the modernization programs.

Sreenivasa Chakravarti Vice President, IoT and Digital Engineering, TCS You have these already downloaded We have sent you a copy of the report to your email again. Most industrial, manufacturing, asset-heavy, and engineering-oriented value chain leaders are focused on digital-led transformation, and we believe future leaders will be those who can harness next-gen IoT, AI, and related technologies. The role of IoT is becoming increasingly integral to the evolution of new business and operating models. Businesses are therefore focused on driving value creation and efficient growth through IoT-led digital transformation and engineering innovations. By doing so, they can boost their overall revenue potential in the market while growing their wallet share among existing customers. From transportation and manufacturing to healthcare, energy, and supply chains, industry leaders are reimagining their businesses using IoT and other digital technologies to create efficiently connected, cognitive, and intelligent value chains. These value chains are geared toward servitization by seamlessly integrating products with services. There is a growing need to transform business operations toward this end by establishing traceability across the as-designed, as-manufactured, as-in use, and as-serviced product management life cycle stages. By deploying a product-as-a-service (PaaS) model with end-to-end life cycle traceability, businesses can efficiently and effectively expand, manage, and continuously enhance their PaaS offerings to drive new value and growth. Looking forward, a technology revolution can catapult IoT-led transformations with advanced levels of capabilities. A connected future will effectively open the door to new collaborative development possibilities for intelligent and sustainable-by-design enterprises and their ecosystem partners. Business heads of research and development, engineering, manufacturing, supply chain, and sustainability will want to keep a close eye on the four converging tech mega trends of software-enabled things, digital twins, AI and GenAI, and edge-to-cloud computing with 5G connectivity. By doing so, they will be better prepared to seize a competitive edge. Technology-forward businesses that embrace change with an IoT and engineering innovation mindset will be in the best position to seize new business growth opportunities. The long-term outlook for the enterprise IoT market is continued growth. According to IoT Analytics research, the size of the enterprise IoT market was $269 billion in 2023 with spending indicating a growth rate recovery beginning in 2025 and a CAGR of 15% estimated until 2030. TCS sees the rapid evolution of software-enabled things, digital twins, AI and GenAI, and seamless edge-to-cloud computing with 5G connectivity as significantly influencing digitalization and contributing to continued growth for businesses during the next few years. We expect a major shift in the business landscape to occur with new opportunities for transformative growth through the convergence of these technologies: New cars sold today, for instance, generally come loaded with software, but certain features are only visible or enabled if a buyer opts to pay for them. The behavior of a vehicle is, therefore, determined based on changes applied within the software configuration rather than the physical hardware. Another example is readily apparent in our use of everyday consumer appliances and electronics—from smart coffee makers and refrigerators to lights and TVs. Today, we can remotely operate and monitor their use from our mobile phones. Such conveniences, which were once a novelty, are now part of our daily life. Digital twins: We believe that we have the data needed to digitally replicate potentially any physical product, facility, or process in a virtual world. In effect, the technology is evolving as a “digital twin of everything.” Through today’s advanced data-centric capabilities, the technology can now be used to create a complete and exact replica of a product, as well as the production facility where it is made and end-to-end supply chain processes. For instance, we can visualize, simulate, and test an automotive or airplane engine in the virtual world before even releasing it in the physical world. Moreover, we can operate it remotely because it is software-enabled. All this is now possible with the technology becoming deeply ingrained in organizations as they scale on their transformation journeys. This level of technological advancement has been enabled by an economic model that clearly shows declining cost points. AI and GenAI: IoT has thrived through its ability to access real-time data-driven insights and predictive analytics using traditional AI. There is an abundance of available data with hyper-connected products, processes, and systems, and the potential for also leveraging contextual information is therefore increasing exponentially. You can now implement a GenAI application with a chatbot interface on top of data to access contextual information across an enterprise. These developments enable more effective and higher-end deployments of AI such as those used for robotics in industrial settings. 45% of executives surveyed believe up to one-half of their employees will be using GenAI daily in three years. Effectively serving as digital assistants to employees, GenAI tools can also be used to facilitate informed decision making with personalized knowledge augmentation capabilities (learn more about becoming a knowledge-driven enterprise). For instance, you can query a system about optimal points of operation based on historical data or the standard deviation of errors in assessing whether to continue production. Based on the global TCS AI for Business Study Key Findings Report, 45% of CEOs and other senior execs believe up to one-half of their employees will be using GenAI daily in 3 years. This anticipated adoption, however, necessitates an integration of the emerging wave of GenAI capabilities with more established industrial AI and rapidly maturing computer vision capabilities with the IoT capabilities. 4. Edge-to-cloud computing with 5G connectivity: Technology advancements in 5G (and with 6G on the horizon) are enabling better bandwidth, faster speeds, and more cost-efficient management in driving this modern computing paradigm. The ability to process data at the device edge or cloud edge, virtually from any IoT-powered device or industrial equipment with seamless integration to the cloud, enables real-time decision-making capabilities. Businesses will have the opportunity to reimagine their value chains through technology convergence, deploying new connect-in-context, predictive, and self-healing capabilities. While technological convergence will act as a catalyst for change, TCS foresees some industries proactively embracing the evolving trends and leading their markets at greater speed. Industry leaders will create systems, processes, and products based on an advanced set of technology capabilities designed to boost both operational efficiencies and effectiveness. By connecting in context, IoT networks will become smarter, enabling the right information to be received at the right place and time. They will have the ability to predict future events and outcomes by analyzing and identifying trends based on historical and contextual data in combination with unstructured data. Using GenAI, various forms of unstructured data may also be analyzed¾from sensor and computer vision data sources to knowledge gleaned through logs and books. Equipped with self-healing adaptive tenets, next-gen systems will autonomously detect and fix problems themselves. An infographic depicting the convergence of four tech mega trends and the future of IoT possibilities illustrated through five strategic deployments. The four tech mega trends include software-enabled things, digital twins, AI and GenAI, and seamless edge-to-cloud computing with 5G connectivity. The five strategic deployments include autonomous journeys, factory of the future, servitization, energy transition, and sustainability by design. The future of IoT possibilities can be illustrated through five strategic deployments: Autonomous journeys: In the new age of self-driving cars, technology and innovation are converging to reimagine journeys with improved navigation capabilities and safety in preventing collisions. The cars must be able to communicate with each other and make split-second decisions. Advancements in edge computing will effectively eliminate the issue of latency by processing data between cars in real time at the source. This real-time data processing capability applies not only to a mobility context but also factory operations and all forms of software-defined products. Factory of the future​: The manufacturing landscape is witnessing a major shift where connectivity and data are fundamentally changing how factories operate for overall increased efficiency and productivity. Enabled with digital intelligence and neural processing capabilities, smart and connected plant operations will essentially think, sense, and act. They will respond and innovate with greater agility based on evolving market demands, supply chain signals, and personalized product configurations while optimizing production runs with modernized and sustainable operations. Servitization: Connected service ecosystems will emerge through the seamless integration of solution and software platform providers with product manufacturers across the value chain. The focus is on delivering personalized value in addressing end-user customer needs through pay-per-use or PaaS models. For instance, smart health services and devices will enable the delivery of more personalized care options with remote and self-monitoring capabilities to help people manage various conditions and improve their well-being. Energy transition: Energy resource consumption and emission patterns among global organizations are rather complex and unpredictable. By combining the use of IoT, edge, and AI-based analytics, businesses will have the data-driven insights needed to build greener value chains and progress their energy efficiency and carbon neutrality goals. Real-time tradeoffs between cost and carbon footprint print, carbon trading, and visibility into the full value chain for carbon intensity will lead to the evolution of an open internet kind of platform for distributed energy exchange. Sustainability by design: Organizations will satisfy continually evolving customer expectations and drive growth into the future by designing operations with business agility and environmental and social responsibility goals in mind. With access to real-time data across a connected value chain for measurement and analysis, businesses can drive new value creation and seize a competitive advantage while supporting a commitment to environmental and social stewardship. The reengineering of legacy products with carbon-friendly materials will be key to attaining sustainability by design. Applying a GenAI-based context to value creation can help to visualize the tremendous potential that awaits with next-gen IoT. When it comes to enabling and driving value creation through IoT, traditional AI combined with the advances in GenAI are emerging as a powerful technology duo. While operational efficiency and productivity gains are still important benefits to realize, the journey to value does not end there. The arrival of GenAI will help deliver on the promise of IoT and unlock new game-changing potential for driving improved operational performance and engineering innovation. Leveraging personalized knowledge augmentation capabilities will drive new value creation by improving strategic thinking and decision-making across an enterprise. The spectrum of progressive business benefits to be realized, for instance, may include improved: While the transformative possibilities of IoT are limitless, there are also business risk and impact considerations that must be addressed to successfully participate in a connected world. To realize value with an IoT-led transformation, three key considerations include: Security risks: The convergence of information technology (IT) and IoT/operational technology (OT) systems in creating a connected value chain can introduce new security vulnerabilities. Wherever there are touchpoints along the value chain between the digital IT and physical IoT/OT realms, there are potential attack points. As industry leaders look to deploy next-gen IoT capabilities, the overall potential benefits versus the risks and costs must be carefully weighed and justified. They must assess what business and operational activities need to be conducted at the edge and the infrastructure requirements versus what should be processed and stored in the cloud or inside a closed premise. Climate impact: Environmental protection and sustainability goals are a top priority for any socially responsible business today. Businesses must therefore ensure that their IoT strategy is future-ready and sustainable by design to contribute toward the global agenda for net zero carbon emissions. According to the World Economic Forum’s Internet of Things Guidelines for Sustainability report, IoT is among the largest enablers for responsible digital transformation, but sustainability goals must be considered early on in the design phase of IoT projects to realize their full potential. The report estimates that by 2030, industrial IoT alone could add up to $14 trillion in economic value with the potential increasing as consumer and public sector IoT use are included. Responsible AI: Businesses must consider how they will manage the change of introducing AI and GenAI into the real world in a sensitive, ethical, and responsible manner to facilitate the acceptance of a collaborative human-machine workforce. They must help employees understand the potential process and performance improvement benefits of leveraging a personalized AI augmentation capability to work smarter rather than viewing it as an existential threat. But empowering employees with AI capabilities, in turn, creates a potential risk that they could expose an enterprise’s competitive engineering intelligence. Safeguards must therefore be implemented to support the responsible use of AI among employees. Because there are tradeoffs with any of these considerations and no straight answers, applying a strategic and comprehensive approach to an IoT-led transformation is paramount to help ensure success. When envisioning a path to transform through IoT, businesses must focus on the dual objective of creating value from an economic and competitive differentiation perspective. The planned investment in edge/IoT computing is expected to rise from 45% to 48%, according to the findings of a recent TCS Global Cloud Study conducted among senior executives. This uptrend is based on the percent who, at the time of the survey, had increased their investments in the past 12-24 months compared to their intended investments in the next 12-24 months. As businesses invest in building an IoT infrastructure and capabilities to support their operations into the future, they must step wisely. Starting with value discovery, business stakeholders must convene to assess their needs and prepare a roadmap by identifying and prioritizing their IoT initiatives through a top-down, holistic approach. Progressing to the value realization step in the journey, the business will then structure and enable the technology backbone to deploy the IoT strategy. At this point, research and development converges with business and operating models. Reaching the value optimization stage, the focus shifts to enhancement, support, and ongoing maintenance. An infographic depicting the overall journey and specific steps to transform through IoT, advancing along a roadmap in three stages from value discovery to value realization and value optimization. The initial stage of the journey is focused on value discovery through business outcome-led thinking, which includes an overall vision and strategy, architecture design, and AI-ready organization design. The second stage is focused on value realization through building and deployment, which includes technology choices, partner and innovation ecosystem development, data strategy and life cycle management, and an integrated approach to the four mega trends. The third and final stage in the journey is focused on value optimization through a sustainable-by-design approach, which includes the transition to superior energy options, adoption of autonomous journeys, an empowered workforce for self-sustained business improvement, and competing on insights. As the four tech mega trends of software-enabled things, digital twins, AI and GenAI, and edge-to-cloud computing with 5G connectivity converge to create the next generation of IoT, new opportunities for business value creation and sustainable growth will rapidly emerge. Business leaders who start preparing for their IoT-led transformations today will gain an edge in their industries.

The banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) industry considers artificial intelligence (AI) a key lever for disruptive transformation. The BFSI industry report of the TCS AI for Business Study reveals that BFSI business executives want to innovate and make money with AI, without just restricting it to a cost-saving tool. According to the report, 67% of executives surveyed tilted toward leveraging AI primarily for innovation and revenue growth compared with just 18% solely focused on using AI to lower costs and optimize operations. We observed a similar trend in the securities and investment services space with three in five B2B finance executives strongly inclined toward using AI for innovation rather than optimization. In capital markets, predictive AI, data analytics, and automation technologies have been traditionally used in areas such as client onboarding, back-office operations, straight-through processing (STP), and risk management. However, with the advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the industry is looking at possibilities for transformative business impact by leveraging composite AI—a combination of these technologies. Technology teams are experimenting with GenAI, running proofs-of-concepts (PoCs) for specific use cases like digital assistants and knowledge management. Firms are considering setting up horizontal GenAI platforms to experiment across multiple business segments such as asset and wealth management, investment management, financial markets, and so on. Given the significant benefits it offers, leading capital markets firms are beginning to embrace GenAI: There is a significant opportunity for AI enablement across capital markets firms. According to findings from the aforementioned study, nearly three-quarters of securities and investment services industry leaders are focused on establishing an enterprise-wide AI strategy or are exploring, preparing, or doing pilots with AI (see Figure 1). A graphic showing what securities and investment service leaders feel about AI. About 22% surveyed want to establish an enterprise-wide AI strategy for maximum benefits for their respective companies. About 26% want to stay true to their purpose while exploring how they can benefit from AI, while about 24% want to experiment and take risks to make the most of AI. Business leaders at top B2B finance firms are looking at adopting GenAI for innovation and revenue growth. In fact, the AI study data shows that 82% of securities and investment services executives say they have AI projects aimed at growing revenue. During the initial stages of any disruptive technology, the art of the possible is often demonstrated by leveraging it for specific use cases, and GenAI has been no exception to this trend. But to successfully scale GenAI adoption in the capital markets domain and realize its true potential, it is imperative to move beyond engaging in point solutions to enhance specific use cases. Business stakeholders must sponsor initiatives aimed at reimagining key functions and existing value chains to deliver strategic advantage and unlock transformative business value. However, convincing business leaders to invest in transformation programs using GenAI is proving to be a challenge. Gaining buy-in from business leaders will demand air-tight business cases, meticulous planning, establishing key business metrics, developing transparent cost structures, and addressing concerns around technology maturity. Above all, identifying high-impact business problems, ideas, and opportunities is crucial as such AI implementations are more likely to get funding. To accomplish this, the discussion must move beyond use cases to areas where GenAI can transform business outcomes (see Figure 2). A graphic showing the various business functions that will benefit from GenAI. It will help increase revenue by making possible new services and customer segments. It will have a positive impact on quality by strengthening research and reporting, and by ensuring better responses to customers. Client service will get a fillip as GenAI will enable self-service, faster customer journeys, and tailored advice. Actionable insights and information summarization will improve efficiency, while reduced operational expenses will ensure cost savings. We believe that the key themes of revenue growth, quality enhancement, and improved client experience will drive GenAI adoption in capital markets. Cost and efficiency optimization are important but will not be primary drivers. However, efficiency and cost optimization will become relevant in fast-growing areas that can leverage GenAI to scale operations without significant increase in expenses. Capital markets organizations must define an enterprise-wise AI approach, incorporating composite AI solutions centered on a business transformation view instead of a technology view. An enterprise-wise AI approach will usher in enterprise-grade transformation by offering comprehensive solutions to business problems—an approach which is certain to capture the attention of CXOs and other top executives rather than a technology-specific point solution approach. An effective AI solution must include capabilities from GenAI, predictive AI, and data analytics. Additionally, while establishing well-defined key performance indicators (KPIs) is crucial to demonstrate the value of AI implementations and gain top management buy-in, our study reveals that only 19% of B2B finance executives believe they have ’good enough’ metrics and KPIs. In capital markets, GenAI offers big opportunities for better business outcomes through disruptive transformation. The study has identified the top challenges to GenAI adoption in securities and investment services. The foremost is ensuring ethical and responsible use of AI (see Figure 3). A graphic showing the three main challenges that securities entities are likely to face while thinking of integrating GenAI into the enterprise strategy. These are: 1) ensuring ethical and responsible use of AI as more employees get access; 2) increased investment in AI research and development as the technology evolves with each new release; 3) Lack of IT readiness (data, integration, cloud, cybersecurity capabilities) to make the most of GenAI. Ethical and responsible AI use: According to the study, 41% of B2B finance executives surveyed expect more than half their employees to be using GenAI daily within the next three years. Consequently, firms will need to enhance focus on ethical and responsible use of AI. This can pose difficulties given the inherent biases of AI systems and the possibility of GenAI hallucinations. Additionally, firms will face problems in ensuring data protection and privacy, accuracy of information provided by the AI tool, and regulatory compliance. Firms must adopt technology solutions that offer guard rails to protect data and eliminate biases. AI research and development: AI is evolving fast, with exponential increase in capabilities with every new release - this is particularly true for GenAI. With every release, firms will need to put in significant research and development effort to understand and integrate these capabilities in a manner that positively impacts business outcomes and customer experience. Keeping pace with the rapid evolution of this technology can, therefore, pose challenges for business leaders. Lack of IT readiness: Business leaders are concerned about the readiness of the technology as well as their infrastructure to accommodate large scale adoption of GenAI. As the technology is evolving rapidly with continuous expansion of capabilities, baselining them is proving difficult. At the same time, a lack of organizational readiness across data, integration, cloud, and cybersecurity can be detrimental for meaningful adoption of AI and GenAI. Sponsorship from business leaders will sharpen the focus of GenAI programs in capital markets firms. Backing from business stakeholders will not only ensure alignment with business objectives and customer needs, but also help identify risks and possible mitigation approaches. Most importantly, it will enable a shift in focus in the GenAI adoption approach from technology themes to business themes such as novel products and services, new customer segments, experience, improved service, and cost transparency. To implement GenAI for transformational business impact, firms must navigate the following stages (see Figure 4). A graphic showing the three stages in an organization’s GenAI adoption journey—explore, experiment, and enhance. The explore stage is when business leaders become aware of the potential of AI and GenAI and what it can do for them. In this stage, a business determines the art of the possible for specific functions such as operations, marketing, customer services. In the experiment stage, organizations go beyond proofs of concepts and develop solutions that generate contextual business value. This can be implemented in a limited and non-intrusive manner across entire value chains. The enhance stage involves companies undertaking transformational programs, by being cognizant of the key risks associated with an AI solution and putting in place measures to mitigate those risks. Explore: Business leaders must understand the potential of AI, and GenAI in particular, and what it can do for them. Awareness and ideation sessions will help determine the art of the possible for specific functions such as operations, marketing, research, or customer services. Technology demonstrations using PoCs will help business leaders visualize the potential. Transformative ideas will emerge from this and PoCs can be run for a few key ones. Experiment: This stage goes beyond PoCs to develop solutions that generate contextual business value. Tools that assist the research team to create a better report or help product teams to quickly design superior brochures or enable service teams to effectively respond to customers can be a great starting point. These solutions must be implemented in a limited and non-intrusive manner across entire value chains. Business leaders must take a decision on whether to scale up after assessing the impact of such solutions using well-defined metrics and KPIs. Enhance: In this phase, business leaders must sponsor transformation programs, providing direction on the key risks associated with the AI solution as well as the mitigation measures to be incorporated. A well-developed business case supported by a roadmap with defined milestones forms the foundation of AI and GenAI programs. IT teams must design scalable solutions that address associated technology risks. Harnessing AI and GenAI technology for specific use cases will have limited impact. A business transformation perspective is imperative for GenAI programs to gain momentum and result in adoption at scale in the capital markets industry. Buy-in from business leaders will be key to success. To realize the true potential of AI, capital markets firms must develop solutions that bring together GenAI, predictive AI, and analytics as part of a wider enterprise AI strategy that effectively leverages its unique capabilities while also addressing risks.

Staying up to date with regulatory requirements, especially in the field of life sciences, is extremely important. Life sciences organizations must adhere to these changing regulations and take data-driven decisions. Manual regulatory website search process is extremely time-consuming and effort-intensive. The sheer data volume, extracting information from unstructured data, limitations of the tools, expertise, and effort required to absorb all the data and interpret the insights for decision making are some of the inherent challenges today. Compliance to data privacy regulations like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) further adds to the complexity. Conversational AI-based solutions have advantages such as natural interaction, contextual awareness, accessibility, scalability, personalization, and multilingual capabilities. LLM (Large Language Model) capabilities include natural language processing, text generation, information retrieval, reasoning, and personalization. Conversational chatbots in tandem with GenAI solutions based on LLMs are useful to address the challenges with regulatory intelligence. They provide reliable, consistent, and robust building blocks to offer conversational assistance to regulatory professionals. By utilizing conversational AI, it is simpler to implement user flow and accommodate business logic easily instead of relying on LLMs to guess the flows. The domain knowledge can be stored in a knowledge repository for easy access. LLMs will help in making the chatbot with minimal training of intents and business flow and providing appealing responses to user queries. The solution comprises of a natural language understanding (NLU) engine capable of performing intent classifications, entity extraction and dialogue management, LLMs, and a knowledge repository. The regulatory assistance chatbot provides an easy-to-use interface to regulatory professionals by eliminating the need to visit different sources. It can provide real-time updates, historical information, and guidance on regulatory changes. The knowledge repository gives the chatbot a contextual understanding of the domain and business knowledge. All these together make it possible to devise an effective regulatory strategy. This ultimately leads to improved compliance, faster decision-making, and better patient outcomes.

Today, finance leaders’ influence on their organization’s growth is significant. They play a pivotal role in steering their companies through potential economic disruptions and geopolitical uncertainties, and identifying avenues for growth and improving operational effectiveness. As they look to balance growth and risk in a dynamic business environment characterized by complexity and uncertainty, new technologies such as GenAI can help them make strategic decisions to power business innovation and finance transformation. GenAI has immense potential to transform the finance value chain and enhance organizational agility. However, finance leaders should not fall prey to “FOMO” or “action bias.”  They must realize that the key to successful AI implementations is identifying strategic functions and processes where the technology can unlock the maximum business value. In the recently conducted TCS Future of Operations Survey, 90% C-suites cited that the top criterion for successful technology deployment is alignment of the right technology to the right processes. GenAI and FP&A are made for each other. GenAI excels in tasks such as handling large datasets, analyzing complex patterns, and generating detailed reports. One of the key finance functions that is ripe for disruption by generative AI is financial planning and analysis (FP&A) as the critical tasks under this function involve forecasting, budgeting, and analyzing financial data that helps strategic decision-making. While traditional AI models have been around for the past decade, they struggle with complex language generation and might require more manual input for report creation. Compared to traditional AI models, GenAI offers improved natural language understanding in the domain of FP&A along with more efficiency and scalability. GenAI solutions can enhance the FP&A function by generating natural language text, automating report writing, and providing insights from large datasets. Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize financial decision-making by automating repetitive tasks, augmenting human capabilities, and providing more accurate and timely insights for decision-makers. It can help organizations improve their financial planning processes, enhance forecasting accuracy, optimize resource allocation, and gain deeper insights into financial performance, risks, and opportunities. GenAI can be a game changer for FP&A. Some of the key use cases are: To enable entirely new ways of working with GenAI, organizations need to fundamentally redesign their operating model. The new digital operating model should be built on core foundational elements that enable an organization to quickly: In the context of FP&A, GenAI tools can be leveraged to automate data convergence and self-healing of data issues. They can sift through large volumes of structured and unstructured orders, contract data, and terms of payments to create a cash flow outlook or recommendations for cash conversion cycle optimization. Not just that, they can apply experiential learning from prior customer behaviors or seasonality to predict major P&L and balance sheet changes. GenAI models can also detect anomalies in financial reports and professionals can then intervene to assess and fix them. Simultaneously, teams can be established to train the models to further improve results and efficiency. This means finance teams can focus more on business strategy, while time-consuming and repetitive tasks can be automated using these cutting-edge tools. Most organizations today are in the early stages of experimentation with GenAI. An operating model aligned to the organization’s long-term strategies, goals, and objectives can help organizations unlock the full potential of GenAI. To understand the efficacy of the model, organizations should have well-defined key performance indicators and reporting mechanisms, and a framework that facilitates decision-making processes. At the same time, they should take into careful consideration the ethical, legal, and privacy implications to ensure responsible use of AI technologies in financial decision-making.

Harish Thennattayil Consultant, Aviation Advisory, Travel and Logistics, TCS You have these already downloaded We have sent you a copy of the report to your email again. The aviation sector is expected to see robust growth in the coming decade, which means MROs are going to get increasingly busy. To be able to deliver superior aircraft maintenance services and ensure zero schedule slippages, MROs will need to expand their resources and capabilities considerably. This calls a transformation of the aircraft maintenance ecosystem, underpinned by technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI-ML), data analytics, GenAI, digital twins, 3D printing, and more. As GenAI begins to disrupt businesses and life as we know it, MROs must prepare to put this technology to good use, delivering manifold benefits for themselves as well as their customers. Traditional AI or predictive AI assists in process excellence such as predictive maintenance, through understanding the underlying patterns and responding to new data sets in the same manner as it is trained. On the other hand, GenAI can understand underlying patterns in the data it is trained on, apply that analysis to new datasets (which can be either labelled or un-labelled) and generate totally different yet meaningful outputs. Given the remarkable insights it can offer GenAI can be used across a wide variety of MRO use cases to drive effective decision making. This technological marvel can aid a business in various ways such as virtual assistance and chatbots, reducing the need for extensive skill sets required for complex aircraft maintenance and operations. Managing the airworthiness of aircraft through regular maintenance, while generating revenue through efficient operations, is anything but easy for MROs. Aircraft maintenance involves a lot of critical decision-making processes, which must be based on accurate insights and observations as they have sizeable financial implications and have a direct bearing on the safety of people. GenAI models can be trained to analyze huge amounts of structured and unstructured data to aid these processes, while reducing the dependence on manual discretion considerably. These models can offer faster and more dynamic solutions for MROs in resolving critical situations such as aircraft on ground (AOG), which have monetary implications, disrupt operations, and inconvenience passengers. With GenAI aiding quick resolutions in such cases, MROs will be able to release aircraft to service a lot faster, thereby improving availability and operational efficiency. GenAI can be fine-tuned to assist maintenance personnel across functions such as material planning, inventory control, and reliability by providing contextual insights to nourish their decision-making capabilities. It is critical for aircraft operators, lessees, lessors, and OEMs to strictly adhere to the airworthiness regulations set by regulatory authorities to ensure continuous and safe operations. Airworthiness Directives (AD) are regulations issued by authorities such as the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) based on findings and observations that may affect the operability of in-service aircraft. These directives are intended to alert the airline or MRO regarding concerns around safety of a particular aircraft type, model, engine, or other systems. Non-compliance of an affected AD on certified aircraft by the compliance due date will result in severe operational consequences. GenAI can be adopted by MROs for managing ADs through their lifecycle – from origination to termination – much more effectively and dynamically. MROs are required to track and report the AD status, right from its effective date through due date, for all affected aircraft, and any non-compliance can adversely affect operations and damage the carrier’s brand. Additionally, GenAI solutions can assist in generating and enterprising AD reports along with insightful suggestions and maintenance solutions. They will be of great help here as it can download ADs from the huge repository, distributing them among affected aircraft with relevant parameters, monitoring, reporting as well as alerting, along with pre-empting and scheduling maintenance activities. The key objective of MROs is to ensure an aircraft is serviceable and operational through most of its life, with minimal downtime and delays at any stage. GenAI can notably contribute here, by offering remote chat assistance to field personnel. Given the ability of large language models (LLM) models to create contextual text, images, and videos from underlying data based on various prompts, they can act as informed chatbots providing contextual information to the MRO workforce. These interactive chatbots can save technicians the time and effort they typically have to spend in laboriously looking through reams and reams of documents to derive contextual insights from a large repository of historical maintenance data. GenAI’s language translation capabilities are incredibly powerful, allowing personnel to communicate easily in the language of their choice, which makes the maintenance process a lot easier and more efficient. LLM models can also be trained to amend or append the underlying documents when prompted. It is critical for MROs to tend to recurring fault messages and warnings, as they could point to possible flaws in a component or system. Aircraft safety architecture is designed to provide fallback systems and robust warning mechanisms for additional security and to minimize disruption during operations. The repeated warnings and fault messages displayed on the aircraft cockpit display units might be considered as a potential threat, which mandates a detailed root cause analysis of the nature of these defects, as well as troubleshooting and conducting the maintenance action to resolve an anomaly. GenAI models can be used to understand the underlying data patterns to group these defects and aid the root cause analysis as well as the maintenance activities that need to be performed. LLM models can cluster these defects based on their nature and other parameters, providing MROs a high level of visibility and deep insights about potential failures that can hinder the integral functionality of various systems and components. To conclude, although real-world use cases are evolving, but GenAI most definitely holds great promise in the field of aircraft maintenance. As GenAI paves the way for a bright future, industry players are working on developing a range of capabilities using this technology to cater to real-world MRO M&E scenarios, some of which will surely see implementation in the near future.

Prashant Deo CTO and Global Head of Security Tools and Engineering, Cybersecurity Dr. Kanwar Preet Singh Sandhu Global Head of Strategic Initiatives, Cybersecurity You have these already downloaded We have sent you a copy of the report to your email again. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is changing the game for companies around the globe. It's bringing previously unimaginable capabilities within reach and enabling exciting business opportunities. Potential use cases range from discovering new drugs, developing virtual reality worlds, and enabling hyper-personalized banking experience to software coding. The opportunities are many, but GenAI technologies are also creating novel cybersecurity risks for enterprises. With the implementation of AI applications built on large language models (LLMs), companies have a new technology environment that must be protected. However, the GenAI domain has characteristics and behaviors that differ fundamentally from the IT environments organizations know—and have experience protecting. Organizations need to realize that the same prompts used to interact with GenAI chatbots could be manipulated by bad actors to get a model to do things or disclose data in unintended ways. Therefore, it is important for organizations to safely manage the privacy and security of extensive data used in these models. Sure enough, cybercriminals are already tapping the power of GenAI to unleash new threats. Enterprises that fear they may be missing out or losing the competitive edge in the AI race may jump on the bandwagon without a robust plan to secure or govern their new GenAI solutions. This rapid unstructured adoption may open doors for cybercriminals, providing them with opportunities to compromise and exploit AI systems. This is why, as companies take the initial steps to explore and implement GenAI to advance their business strategies, they need to pursue a rigorous and proactive AI cybersecurity defense. These efforts should move forward in lockstep to ensure that AI implementations—and associated risks—are effectively managed by the cybersecurity team. As a starting point for this, the cybersecurity team needs to identify all the AI and machine learning (ML) assets in the enterprise and assess the risks they present. The cybersecurity leadership should develop AI-specific security policies and standards, setting clear expectations and establishing necessary guardrails. Wherever they expect LLM capabilities to be added to their IT environment, or sensitive company data fed into such models, they need to bring in robust procedures and policies. Software security engineering and processes should be modified to consider LLM-related security and privacy. An organization's AI cybersecurity strategy must align with its objectives of protecting data integrity and confidentiality, safeguarding privacy, and preventing adversarial attacks like model theft or evasion. It must also clearly articulate its principles around reliability of models, minimization of data, and privileges. As adoption widens, enterprises must establish standards and governance to ensure that effective controls are implemented—in the engineering and operational environment and throughout the development life cycle. The strategy must include assurance testing to validate the security and privacy of any ML and AI models the organization is using or plans to use. Bad actors are likely to exploit a wide range of potential vulnerabilities. This will occur as companies tap into the power of LLMs and other new technologies, adding to the complexity of the cybersecurity mandate. Among the issues of concern, as generative AI becomes more deeply integrated into the enterprise IT landscape, are the following: Firms need to urgently address the risks arising from the adoption of GenAI models. These risks can be new and, in some cases, unique. The key considerations that may help the enterprise to develop a robust approach to prevent these risks include the following: Further, there should be security architecture reviews and threat modeling to assess model design for robustness and inherent resistance to attacks. Adversarial training should be incorporated so that the model is exposed to simulated attack scenarios during its training phase. Indirect prompt injection can be defended against by using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and filtering retrieved inputs to remove harmful instructions. Other techniques that can be leveraged are an LLM moderator to detect sophisticated attacks and interpretability-based solutions for outlier detection. As enterprises enter uncharted territory, strategies to de-risk the adoption of GenAI solutions are imperative. It has now become clear that AI capabilities will themselves be indispensable to improve cybersecurity teams: Fire will be fought with fire. Even as GenAI presents security leaders with new challenges, it brings new tools that can boost the effectiveness and efficiency of cybersecurity defenses. GenAI holds the potential to revolutionize the field, significantly improving threat detection and response times through automated analysis, while also delivering real-time summarized actionable threat intelligence. New technology streamlines entitlements, enables conditional access controls, and automates the generation and enforcement of access policies. It reduces the risk of human error, alleviating alert fatigue by automating routine tasks such as log analysis, among other areas. It ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive information. Another place where GenAI solutions may play a role is in continuous compliance with regulatory requirements through automated collection and analysis of compliance data. As cyber adversaries increasingly attack the AI ecosystem, enterprises must bravely step into this new era by de-risking its adoption—and by leveraging advanced AI technology to combat sophisticated cyberattacks. The achievable goal is to enhance overall cyber resilience, countering sophisticated threats and addressing an ever-present skills gap in this critical domain.

Ramalingeswara Rao Balla Chief architect, Manufacturing, TCS You have these already downloaded We have sent you a copy of the report to your email again. The automotive industry is evolving at an unprecedented pace with increased focus on electric, connected, and autonomous vehicles. Technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud, virtual reality, and IoT are acting as catalysts to that change. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has the capability to truly transform the way automotive businesses are run. It can help with forecasting demand with a great deal of accuracy, manage inventory a lot better, and take customer experience several notches up. When integrated with manufacturing process, GenAI will shorten design cycles, fuel product innovation, and boost sales and marketing efforts. By addressing the challenges of longer design cycles, vehicle safety, warranty payouts against fraudulent claims, and higher service repair time in the absence of the right diagnostic mechanisms, GenAI will enable automakers to drive profitable growth and keep pace with market dynamics. Automakers can leverage GenAI across the product lifecycle to create maximum value. In fact, some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are already experimenting with it. Mercedes-Benz, for instance, integrated ChatGPT with its in-car voice control infotainment system, MBUX Voice Assistant, to elevate driving experience. The technology, integrated in about 900,000 Mercedes vehicles through Azure OpenAI service, helps drivers to inquire about their destination or answer complex questions. Toyota Research Institute (TRI) unveiled a GenAI technique last year to amplify vehicle designers’ capabilities. With this, Toyota designers can add initial design sketches and engineering constraints into their creative process, thus cutting down the iterations needed to reconcile design and engineering considerations. Figure 1 shows a few use cases for GenAI across the automotive value chain. The diagram shows a few use cases for GenAI across the automotive value chain. That include product innovation, product lifecycle management, manufacturing the car, supply chain management, marketing, sales and distribution, finance and leasing, and charging and after-sales service. Within product innovation, GenAI can help in research analysis, regulatory compliance, and virtual design. For managing the lifecycle of products, part rationalization, product reliability analysis, and end to end cost analysis are some of the advantages that can be reaped by using GenAI. Similarly, with smart manufacturing, plant safety and quality control are some of the important benefits that can be obtained.
With GenAI, auto makers can forecast demand, optimize use of logistics and manage supplier contracts. The value chain can be further extended when GenAI is used in marketing in content design, lead management, and campaigns. Similarly, with GenAI, automakers can personalize incentives for customers. For finance and leasing, the new technology can help in loyalty program and campaigns. For after-sales service, GenAI can help in warranty anomalies detection, customer self-service, and troubleshooting for technicians. The three key building blocks of the GenAI architecture are data processing, machine learning (ML) models, and feedback loops. The architecture should be designed such that it generates new and original content based on input data or rules. It should include digital platforms, utility building blocks, external applications, and core building blocks, along with stakeholders. Gen AI feedback and improvement, generative model, and data processing are the key layers related to GenAI. The architectural building blocks of GenAI may vary slightly based on the selected use cases and the respective manufacturing enterprise architecture decisions. Figure 2 shows the standard building blocks of such a layered architecture. The diagram shows that manufacturing stakeholders, which include customers, dealers, distributors, and partners, sit at the top of the reference architecture. This is followed by the user interface (UI) layer, services layer, and business layer which already exist within an enterprise. The Gen AI feedback and improvement layer, which sits below the business layer, will continuously improve the architecture’s accuracy and efficiency with user feedback. Digital platforms, utility building blocks, cloud, and external apps will be the standard building blocks of the architecture. 
The generative model layer, the penultimate one, will be responsible for creating new content or data through various ML models. These models will leverage deep learning or reinforcement learning, depending on the use case and data type to be generated. Finally, the data processing layer will be used to collect, prepare, and process the data to be used by the ML models. Within that base layer, the data collection block will gather data and the data preparation block will clean it. The feature extraction block will identify the most relevant features of the data.

While GenAI offers several benefits, the automotive industry also needs to be cognizant of the risks and challenges. The most common risks are data security, biasness of the system, and trust in the outcome. All of these can have adverse and serious consequences, including the loss of human life. Some of the risks are: Data privacy: GenAI often requires access to personal information to authenticate authorized users. Sensor data is collected to help the vehicle understand where it is relative to other objects on the road. AI uses the dataset associated with a particular vehicle to personalize and enhance navigation features to plan personalized routes for drivers. If a hacker gains access to this data, information about the owner or passengers, such as where they live and work and the specific locations they frequent, could be compromised and misused. Manufacturers should also restrict the collection and retention of personal data to only what is needed for the system to function properly in order to reduce the risk of potential privacy breaches. Before using data for training GenAI, personal information should be pseudonymized to ensure individuals cannot be identified from generated outputs. Manufacturers using GenAI tools should clearly communicate to data subjects (vehicle occupants) their data collection, data storage, and data usage practices, and should only process personal data for disclosed purposes. GDPR and the  EU AI Act could impact how data is handled, processed, protected, secured, and used. Manufacturers must thoroughly analyze the impact of such regulations on their AI-based tools or products. Machine learning models may need to be retrained when the data subject withdraws their consent. Algorithmic bias and fairness:  If the training data sets in the models contain biased information, the resulting AI systems will be biased in their decision-making. This can produce discriminatory decisions, which can have serious legal and ethical implications. A human-in-the -loop is needed to identify outlier prompts and responses requiring human intervention. Data and model security: AI systems rely on large amounts of data and security of that data is paramount. Hackers can manipulate the inputs to the models to produce incorrect outputs. This can lead to incorrect decisions, which can have negative consequences. Therefore, it is important to design and develop secure AI models. Trust:  A biased and compromised AI model is bound to have concerns over the authenticity and accuracy of its responses. Other concerns include user identity verification and the potential for misuse of such products. Human-in-loop systems coupled with rigorous real-world testing can go a long way in addressing these concerns. Intellectual property (IP): Manufacturers will have to understand and find out how they can protect their IPs by using GenAI models. Copyright or IP breaches from third parties will be a bigger cause of concern, as GenAI models can source information from a vast pool of data over the internet. Explainability (interpretability):  Many existing AI systems are not designed for explainability, and they are sometimes opaque in their decision-making processes. It is important to develop explainable AI systems, to build trust and confidence, that provide clear and transparent explanations for their decision-making processes. A connected, collaborative, and cognitive ecosystem will help automotive companies take the next big leap in the manufacturing process. And GenAI will play a pivotal role in it.

Employees are increasingly demanding personalized experiences. Just like with so many products and services they use in their daily life, at work also, they are looking for solutions that offer intuitive recommendations and guided learnings. GenAI can be a key differentiator in improving efficiency, productivity, and engagement of the workforce. With its intuitiveness, contextualization, and hyper-personalization abilities, the technology can foster the 3Ps of employee experience—productivity, emPowerment, and purpose. And HR departments are quickly catching up on this. While fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) will enable the technology infrastructure, the challenge will be building human capabilities within HR teams to bring out the best in AI models. GenAI literacy and a curiosity-driven culture within HR teams will be critical to the success of employee experience programs. GenAI output may encounter errors, hallucinations, or catastrophic forgetting as the first-generation models are perfected. If left unaddressed, such deviations from desired outputs could have an adverse impact on employee trust and experience. This presents an intriguing challenge that requires vigilant monitoring of both data quality and quantity by the HR team. For example, GenAI-enabled employee profile summaries and performance data can be leveraged to make important decisions on manpower planning, recruitment, promotions, and other HR management concerns. However, in the absence of thorough anomaly detection methods and governance, the generated output may contain errors or hallucinations. This could be due to sampling bias because of underrepresentation of certain skills or groups, training on inadequate or biased data points, data imputation, or various other issues. Another challenge is the persisting fear that GenAI may replace jobs and displace workers, potentially leading to resistance from employees and HR functions to adopting GenAI. This can create a negative feedback loop that organizations must manage over time. Overcoming the challenge will require the right communication with employees. The future value of GenAI is in specifics and goes beyond generalization. Getting true value from LLM models requires new skills in deep contextualization. GenAI models are amazing for general purpose usage, but organizations can drive real value when they fully contextualize solutions to create, for instance, company policies, organizational communication, press releases and marketing materials, and management reports. This will require bringing together organizational, domain, and universal knowledge. Next, organizations need to build new synergies with next-gen technologies. The collaborative interaction of discriminative AI, robotic process automation (RPA), and LLMs can maximize the output of GenAI use cases. Predictive AI can be used to forecast suitable job openings based on roles and experience, and automatically track the progress of an application. This can include scheduling interviews and providing status updates. GenAI excels in generating tailored content to help employees learn and prepare effectively for internal interviews. Constructive interaction and synergy among these technologies can lead to comprehensive workplace solutions that will meet employee aspirations. GenAI will deliver maximum value when collaborating with the most empathetic human minds and human-centered design experts. Human creativity will be critical to building connections and bringing cross-disciplinary output, as also in ensuring responsibility and governance at each stage of GenAI output creation. Figure 1: Value drivers during GenAI implementation An infographic that highlights the three value drivers for GenAI implementation. The first driver, specific context alignment, refers to how LLMs and existing GenAI technology can be captured by bringing together organization, domain, and universal knowledge. The second driver, GenAI with composability, refers to use cases can derive maximum value when narrow AI, automation and LLM play together. Lastly, the third driver, human-machine unification, refers to how human creativity will maximize the GenAI outcome when humans and machines collaborate. Employee experience architecture will undergo a massive change along with the introduction of a new GenAI layer. Enterprise data architecture within the HR organization will feed the GenAI architecture and enable LLM models to create an elevated output for employee experience. Here, GenAI will leverage enterprise strategy, technology, multi-nodal data points, talent information, people skills, and processes to create original content impacting empowerment, productivity, and employees’ sense of purpose. Figure 2: GenAI-influenced employee experience architecture An infographic illustrating how the 3Ps of employee experience, which comprise productivity, empowerment, and purpose, will change drastically thanks to a three-layered architecture. The architecture includes the following: an experience layer incorporates employee experience in the design to enable empathetic event handling. The GenAI layer provides contextual, intuitive, and conscious insights for content processing and fine-tuning. And the enterprise data layer manages employee demographics, data, and policies thanks to data inventories and knowledge management. Use cases Successful GenAI programs are already in action at forward-looking organizations. Some of these are: Use case one: In-context support for newly onboarded employees GenAI has tremendous potential to transform the performance of newly onboarded employees. Let’s take the case of a recently joined procurement analyst tasked with supplier evaluation, contract negotiation, and monthly supply cost reporting. While the analyst can handle general tasks on her own, navigating exceptional scenarios will require contextual understanding. For example, when faced with an expired vendor contract, a new employee may struggle to navigate through the organization's hierarchy to seek information on the contract. GenAI can leverage well-trained LLMs to intuitively intervene in company resources and explore extensive domain knowledge, such as terms that need to be considered, whether there should be an extension, or any pricing negotiation clauses. GenAI can connect the current requirements to past actions in the company's data network and provide the required summary of information on extension or renewal of a contract as desired by the analyst. This acts as a starting point for her to put up a case with the right stakeholders. In this use case, GenAI will not only empower the employee with domain knowledge and digestible summaries, but also make her productive from day one. Use case two: Bridging the gap between employee readiness and purposeful career opportunities Traditional learning trajectories designed to support internal career mobility might no longer offer genuine insights into the emerging career landscape that employees may see in the next five years. So far, AI has been able to calibrate and make predictions through the conventional summary of job descriptions, resumes, or skills, resulting in a successful match. However, it can go beyond identifying skills gaps and learning journeys, and can coach employees and prepare them for interviews. Often, internal job positions go unfilled not due to lack of capabilities, but because candidates struggle for the right guidance. GenAI can provide timely advice, big picture insights into a role, job expectations, behavior skills required, and a readiness plan based on previous successes. It can even contextualize interview questions based on an interviewee’s profile and past background. Based on the content from internal and external nodal points, it can serve as an interview assistant, helping candidates model interviews and prepare using simulations. This use case helps aspiring employees identify opportunities for career growth and empowers them with all the information to tap those opportunities, in a few prompts. Use case three: Injecting consciousness into employee appraisals and feedback GenAI can enrich the feedback process by addressing human bias due to the recency effect. For employee interactions or surveys, GenAI can provide a neutral summary of all interactions and events over a specific period. For an annual IT survey, for example, an LLM can summarize an employee's interactions with the IT department, highlighting the department’s performance against a service. This unbiased layer of information aids the function in responding to the survey. A comparable scenario can be drawn during performance assessments. LLMs can mitigate biases, common in human nature, by generating performance summaries linked to multimodal data points. For example, it can be used to counter the tendency to overemphasize projects shifting from red to green, acknowledging the proactive problem-solving of consistently green projects. GenAI can empower managers with contextualized and information-synthesized performance feedback summaries, reducing cognitive bias. All of these use cases elevate consciousness, making employees feel empowered and productive, thereby serving the true purpose of feedback and evaluations. A GenAI framework for HR Prioritizing which HR use cases to pursue in a rapidly evolving technology landscape requires the right framework and choices. We recommend a framework that analyzes use cases and prioritizes them based on the impact on employee experience and ease of implementation. The figure below provides a sample of 10 indicative HR use cases. Enterprises choose the right GenAI use case for enhanced experience and return on investment. Figure 3: A priority framework for GenAI use cases impacting employee experience The infographic highlights how the TCS Prioritization Framework determines the priorities of various GenAI use-cases impacting employee experience. The infographic maps ten sample GenAI use cases to a quadrant chart that showcases what the impact on employee experience would be against the ease of implementation from low effort to high effort. The chart allows you to focus on low effort tasks with high impact, while strategizing on how to achieve high effort, high impact tasks. You may also decide that some high effort low impact tasks are not necessary. The way forward GenAI will reshape how organizations assist their customers, engage with employees, and manage their work processes. The GenAI disruption is clearly driving major investments in the HR and customer engagement areas, and this investment is merely the beginning of what lies ahead. GenAI can bridge the distance with employees and make the relationship between employers and employees increasingly non-transactional. By taking care of routine tasks, it can free up HR business partners’ time for more meaningful employee connects. Unlike conventional AI, GenAI applications can add an emotional angle to employee engagement and enable HR departments to make empathy-based decisions. It is evident that enterprises that can utilize GenAI in a planned, cost-effective, and ethical manner will gain a strategic, competitive edge. As a first step, HR must start with a GenAI fitment assessment of their HR-IT ecosystem and arrive at use cases for elevating the 3Ps of employee experience. The assessment should involve deep-dive discovery across personas, processes, and current technology landscape, thereby identifying employee journeys and user stories that can be transformed with GenAI.

From customer care to marketing and sales, from field operation opportunities to network design, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can reimagine the telco value chain. The timing is advantageous by any measure. Telcos stand at an important crossroads with fierce competition, plateauing revenue streams, and heavy investments necessitated by the accelerating adoption of 5G, edge computing, and gigabit network technologies. With market dynamics and economic circumstances demanding further efficiency and optimization, AI is not just a technological option, it's a strategic imperative. The convergence of reasoning and recognition intelligence into generative models marks a pivotal moment for telcos. In the TCS 2023 Global Cloud Study, about 77% of telecom respondents said they increased investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the past one to two years. The same number (77%) of respondents said they planned to invest in AI-ML in the next one to two years. Communications service providers (CSPs) are experimenting with AI technologies, incorporating reasoning and recognition forms of intelligence. Generative AI use cases across the value chain for telecom companies are in: In Figure 1, we list these six value streams, and relevant use cases of generative AI for a telco. It is important to note that in most of these examples, intelligent technologies are digital assistants for humans, not their replacement. Artificial intelligence will augment humans in their day-to-day work, empowering them to make consistently better decisions and innovate in a way that transforms the entire organization.

GenAI focus areas for telcos AI: Then to now Initially, AI focused on recognition tasks, like identifying objects in images. Its next iteration involved reasoning; analyzing what is happening, why it is happening, the likely outcomes, what we should do about it, and decision-making based on that understanding. The most transformative shift occurred with the advent of generative or operative capabilities, exemplified by large language models (LLMs) like generative pre-training transformer (GPT), language model for dialogue applications (LaMDA), and large language model meta AI (LLaMA). These models leverage predictions made during the reasoning stage to make decisions and propose actions. GenAI and large language models can potentially extract insights from unstructured content. Foundational models, such as GPT, LLaMA and open-source alternatives, are ‘world-wise,’ able to integrate common knowledge that may exist offline, such as in books or in art. By combining such models with ‘enterprise-wise’ ones and traditional AI-ML techniques, telcos can create a knowledge superstructure. Transforming the potential of GenAI into sustained performance requires a multidimensional strategy and an enterprise architecture optimized for cost, quality, security, and privacy. In short, it requires a tailored fit, not a one-size-fits-all solution. The journey is complex, demanding meticulous preparation in terms of data, environment, and the potential creation of purposive agents tailored for specific tasks or activities. Choosing the right mix of intelligence, such as large language models or predictive AI, involves numerous decisions, making the solution-building process intricate. Drawing on our extensive experience in working with hundreds of global telcos, we take a best practice approach to help telcos master the delicate balance of opportunity and risk to ensure successful outcomes. Built on the principles of an industry-led, data-fueled and ecosystem-enabled foundation, we offer an ‘enterprise-wise’ approach designed to make AI consumable for an enterprise-grade transformation (see Figure 2). An infographic that breaks down the four principles of an AI approach. The industry-led approach needs AI to be contextualized for the value chain of the industry being served. The data-fueled approach makes data an integral part of an AI-led transformation. An ecosystem-enabled approach needs ecosystem partners to be involved in creating solutions. An enterprise-wise approach requires AI to unlock enterprise and industry specific tacit knowledge. An “Enterprise-wise” AI adoption approach These four principles underpin our approach to converting AI potential to performance, a continuum that builds upon and reinforces each stage: assist, augment, transform (see Figures 3). An infographic detailing the TCS path of AI potential to performance, a continuum that builds upon and reinforces each stage. The first stage, assist, ensures machines boost human capabilities, enables knowledge discovery and summarization, supplements tacit knowledge with contextual knowledge to boost work effectiveness. The next stage is augment where machines and humans collaborate to optimize activity. This accelerates performance through collaborative intelligence, where humans assist machines and machines assist humans to complement and magnify each other's talents. The last stage is transform where the value chain is redefined and where machines elevate performance, leading to innovation. This helps telcos move from systems of record and reliance on tacit knowledge to a knowledge-driven superstructure with fast, consistent, and high-quality decision output, delivering new ways of working and leading to the realization of an enterprise-wise AI. TCS AI continuum – telco An AI evolution in action Assist: In an example business scenario, a broadband customer contacts the communication service provider’s contact center to complain about the poor internet connectivity. The agent attending to the customer must understand the context and know the troubleshooting steps to fix the issue. A GenAI-based assistant retrieves the customer profile, context, and previous call history to help the agent better understand the customer and assists with the relevant resolution process and frequently asked questions (FAQs) from the knowledge base. Augment: In the same business scenario, the agent explores the customer’s network issue more deeply, and needs to initiate network diagnostic tests, schedule a service technician visit and other tasks as part of the resolution process. The agent will also need to post a summary of the resolution and update the records for closure. GenAI augmentation automates these actions, including initiating the network diagnostic tests, auto-scheduling technician field visit, summarizing the call resolution details, and updating the service desk. Transform: Using the same business scenario, when the customer connects with the contact center to discuss network issues, the GenAI-powered bot directly interacts with the customer using natural language processing. The bot understands the issue by analyzing the customer's account data, network activity in their area, and historical service requests. It then automatically diagnoses the potential cause, like high traffic or a modem issue, and provides personalized responses. These can include self-guided troubleshooting steps with clear instructions and video demonstrations, along with options to schedule a technician visit with real-time availability slots. The virtual assistant pre-populates the work order with the identified issue and temporarily boosts the internet speed, if possible and flags potential network anomalies to the telco. Freed from all but exceptional customer calls, the human agents and network engineers can analyze the flagged report to recommend updates that could prevent future outages. Case in point: Customer experience transformation Figure 4 provides an illustration of TCS CX Transformer for Telcos, an AI-powered service framework that helps in enhancing the experience across every touchpoint of the customer’s journey, improving customer satisfaction (CSAT), customer retention, and net promoter score (NPS) and maximizing the customer lifetime value. An infographic detailing the four major phases of TCS CX Transformer for Telcos. The first stage of this generative AI-powered service is campaign which covers promotion to lead and lead to qualify, the second is acquire which covers qualify to order and order to activation, the third stage is engage which covers usage to payment and complaint to solution, and the final stage is retain which covers insight to loyalty and retention and growth. There are multiple touchpoints across every stage of the customer journey which include online search, social channels, website, comparison, store visit, product reviews, live interactions, test, trails, demo, plan options, guided selling, onboarding, device setup, SMS, chatbot, app updates, payment options, mail, SMS confirmation, call center or interactive voice response, virtual agent, offers or value added services, service levels, newsletter or direct mails, surveys and feedback, usage history and pattern, moving average convergence/divergence options, and service improvement insights. 

Under campaign, it delivers personalized, targeted campaigns using customer insights derived from social media. 

Under acquire, it enhances sales performance through up-sell and cross-sell opportunities. 

Under engage, it reimagines customer service through contextual, personalized conversations. 

Under retain, it leads to immersive, contextual loyalty campaigns driving customer retention. GenAI infusion for transforming CX across the telco customer journey It can be challenging to develop a robust business case, when it’s difficult to quantify the business benefits and cost of AI. Any AI solution must start with the opportunity to augment business value, prioritizing use cases instead of starting with technology adoption. For telcos to fully unlock AI’s potential, they need access to a multi-tier architecture (see Figure 5) and integration with the enterprise systems. Figure 5 shows the TCS enterprise architecture framework for telcos. An infographic detailing a multi-layered, multi-tiered AI architecture and framework for telcos. The bottom-most layer predominantly enables the compute, network and storage as a foundation coupled with public and hybrid clouds, and the existing enterprise IT and systems of record such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. The layer above enables foundational large language models (LLMs) for a variety of knowledge management use cases. The next layer constitutes AI-enabled purposive and contextual task agents that enable various moving parts of AI, such as fine-tuning of AI models on an ongoing basis, establishing the necessary guardrails for responsible and ethical implementation of AI, and a strong ML and LLM capability for continuous learning by the models. The final layer comprises task agents that interact with each other in a seamless fashion with a human-in-the-loop for validation, verification, and disambiguation.

This is part two of our two-part series on Harnessing the power of AI for retail. For part 1, visit here. Retailers need a customized approach to take AI from potential to sustained performance. Initially, artificial intelligence (AI) focused on recognition tasks such as identifying objects in images. Its next iteration involved reasoning –  analyzing what is happening, why it is happening, what the likely outcomes are, what we should do about it, and decision-making based on that understanding. The most transformative shift happened with the advent of generative or operative capabilities, exemplified by large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, LaMDA, and LLaMA. These models leverage predictions made during the reasoning stage and can make decisions and propose actions. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and LLMs have the potential to extract insights from such unstructured content. Foundational models, such as GPT, LLaMA, and open-source alternatives are ’world-wise’ and are able to integrate common knowledge that may exist offline, such as in books or paintings. By combining such models with ’enterprise-wise’ ones and traditional artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, retailers can create a knowledge superstructure. In this second part of a two-part series, Harnessing the power of AI for retail, we explore how TCS leverages GenAI for retail value chains and the myths and cautions around AI implementations. ( See Part 1 here.) For successful AI implementations, retailers need to achieve a balance of opportunities versus risk. We approach composite AI—that is, predictive AI combined with generative AI—across three categories: AI for business While there is a lot that can be done by AI, it is important to evaluate and prioritize where it can add the most value, while considering and balancing the risks. Figure 1 shows use cases powered by AI that can create business value for retailers. The image shows a table of five focus areas for stores, omnichannel retail, merchandizing, supply chain management, and customer service, and also includes relevant use cases and target personas, and the potential benefits GenAI will bring to each. AI for business: Retail use cases IT for AI Built upon the principles of industry-led initiatives, ecosystem collaboration, and cloud-based infrastructure, enterprise-intelligent AI aims to scale outcomes, enabling organizations to leverage AI potential for reshaping value chains and operational methodologies, as shown in Figure 2. This image shows a multi-layered, multi-tiered AI architecture and framework for retailers. The bottom-most layer predominantly enables the compute, network, and storage as a foundation coupled with public and hybrid clouds, and the existing enterprise IT and retail systems of record such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, point of sale (PoS) systems. The layer above enables foundational large language models (LLMs) for a variety of knowledge management use cases—fashion or pharmacy LLMs, pricing and promotion and merchandizing analytics and insights embedded in a frictionless DevSecOps ecosystem. The next layer constitutes AI-enabled purposive and contextual task agents that enable various moving parts of AI, such as fine-tuning of AI models on an ongoing basis, establishing the necessary guardrails for responsible and ethical implementation of AI, and a strong ML and LLM capability for continuous learning by the models. The final layer comprises task agents that interact with each other in a seamless fashion with a human-in-the-loop for validation, verification, and disambiguation. TCS AI architecture for retailers AI for IT This approach primarily focuses on the software development life cycle (SDLC), DevSecOps, and AIOps within the IT domain driven by copilot, code whisperer, and the like. Retailers need to look at enterprise IT holistically and explore opportunities for leveraging AI while keeping in mind its pitfalls around accuracy, plagiarism, intellectual property (IP) dimensions, and enterprise context (see Figure 3). An infographic illustrating how retail enterprises can use AI in IT operations. AI can be used to accelerate software development and improve code quality and for intelligent automation. It can be leveraged to offer personalized customer support through chatbots and virtual assistants and for automating documentation. Retailers can also adopt AI-driven automation for data and cybersecurity operations. AI can also optimize network performance and security. Retailers must enable guardrails and develop best practices for ethical AI adoption. AI in IT operations Making it work: The building blocks for AI in retail An AI-first architecture for retail encompasses a multi-dimensional architecture across different layers as seen in Figure 4. An infographic depicting an AI-first architecture for retail. The digital foundation layer forms the base and includes platform services, encompassing GPUs, Big Data, and cloud services. It is followed by the AI foundation layer, which includes elements such as foundation models, data pipeline for AI, model training and finetuning, and AI observability tools. The retail intelligence layer includes AI- enabled functions for stores, omnichannel retail, merchandizing and, so on. The customer experience layer consists of NLP, Computer Vision, and speech recognition. AI-first architecture for retail Retailers need to proactively address risks associated with AI implementations. GenAI comes with inherent risks and challenges (see Table 1) that need to be understood and addressed appropriately. Myth 01.


Al is plug-and-play Reality: While AI promises multitudes of generative capabilities off the shelf, businesses need to consider that the value can only be realized when contextualized to their business domain, enterprise topology, and business objectives. This requires complex orchestration, purposeful curation, and adoption of these AI capabilities to an enterprise. Retail implications (example): Off-the-shelf GenAI capabilities for a knowledge companion will only know the generic process for a planogram setup. To be effective, however, it would require sizeable contextual adaptation to lines of business (LoB) (grocery, apparel, electronics), retailer-specific store layouts, nuances of retailer-specific catalog and assortment, and the technology landscape. 02.


GenAl is a silver bullet Reality: Pragmatically evaluating options – automation vs. composite Al vs. predictive Al vs. generative Al –  based on business value, cost, and complexity is essential. While GenAI holds a lot of promise, it is very important to do a critical evaluation of the use case to ensure it has a business case. Retail implications (example): Addressing manual effort and errors in visual receiving requires composite Al capabilities, combining generative Al for image classification and predictive Al for quality checks. 03.


Every GenAI use case has a business case Reality: While Al offers numerous capabilities across the retail value chain, careful evaluation is required to determine the return on investment (RoI) implications, customer impact, enterprise positioning in the market, stakeholder management and most importantly, the impact on employees and society at large. Retail implications (example): Generating product ideas to reduce cost and improve assortment profitability may demonstrate an attractive value proposition with AI, but that might not pass the lens of RoI and quality impact for customers and could compromise sustainability, causing the business to veer off from conscious retailing. 04.


Cost considerations are crucial for Al adoption Reality: Al-powered intelligence could provide a sizable advantage to retail enterprises through opportunities for market growth, cost reduction, or customer experience enhancement. However, this intelligence, if not harnessed through effective designs and contextual solutioning, could become cost prohibitive. Retail implications (example): The solution design for realizing intelligent multi-modal search requires careful thinking on data readiness for AI as it might exponentially increase the infrastructure cost. It is also prone to high cost of GenAI consumption during usage if not designed to innovatively optimize the intelligence generation and consumption. 05.


Al and automation will be separate initiatives Reality: Al and automation can complement each other, as Al can intelligently perform tasks, which then would not require any automation. Whereas automation can address certain problems, which might otherwise result in over-engineering with Al. As a result, it is critical to consider AI and automation in unison for the set of value chains under consideration. Retail implications (example): AI will be required to optimize the demand forecast, and automation can efficiently address demand distribution and allocation management. 06.


Right data is sufficient to enable Al Reality: Realizing the full potential of Al requires data in a suitable consumption-ready state. This means just having the data is not sufficient. A robust data strategy and stewardship to ensure data quality and format suitability will be key drivers for maximizing value from AI investments. Retail implications (example): A store receipt might have the data of a customer, product, price, tax, and promotion data, which then has to be modularized and feature engineered for intelligent insights. Selecting the right model requires a comprehensive strategy that looks at data privacy, security, reliability, and other factors. While retailers focus on selecting the right model for their enterprise needs, it is also critical to understand precautions to be undertaken when using these models. Retailers need to take a multidimensional approach for reaping short- and long-term benefits of AI. As with many recent technology revolutions, the short-term impact is often overestimated while the long-term impact is underestimated. Moving forward, retailers must navigate the delicate balance between opportunity and risk associated with AI adoption. It's imperative to proactively address key myths and cautions surrounding AI implementation, ensuring a comprehensive strategy that accounts for factors such as data privacy, security, and reliability. The excitement to embrace AI should be carefully balanced with considerations of legal, indemnity, IPR, and other risks related to ownership and abuse. Retailers must also weigh in other factors necessitating responsible adoption of AI. Moreover, a tailored approach to AI integration, considering the specific needs and capabilities of each enterprise, is essential for maximizing the benefits of AI across various dimensions of retail operations. Ultimately, the true value of AI in retail lies in its ability to augment human capabilities, enhance productivity, deliver next-gen experiences, and drive transformative changes in retail. See part 1 of this two-part series The TCS advantage Our strong partnerships help retail organizations successfully navigate GenAI transformations to drive sustained performance.

Should you buy or build your generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models? That’s one of the most pressing questions business leaders addressed at the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos, as I found out in a debate on GenAI this week. It’s front of the mind for industry leaders as the technology is advancing rapidly and requires substantial investment—particularly when you’re looking to build tools like Large Language Models (LLMs). When approaching this decision, many feel like they are entering a candy store, where the technological possibilities are at once enticing and the choice overwhelming. Here are some key focus areas to inform your discussion: Making the most of existing solutions and utilising them effectively. Our current strategy is to consume existing solutions, especially LLMs, where there are several options and the cost of building from scratch can seem prohibitive, particularly for smaller businesses. Buying readymade AI models allows in-house technical experts to focus on deploying them rapidly to add value to the enterprise. We anticipate that over time we will see a combination of small and large models emerge. But for now, the emphasis will continue to be on exploiting available resources and incorporating them effectively. Combining the power of cloud platforms and emerging AI technologies. We see a significant opportunity to utilise the power of cloud platforms as a secure way into AI. Cloud technologies can provide a means to explore the right guardrails, uphold the highest security levels, and ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Organisations can then use their experience in cloud development to get ahead in this area. Initial findings of the TCS AI for Business Study revealed that 46% of executives plan to create their own LLMs. It’s a complex challenge for any organisation and requires enormous network resources to optimise the models for cost, quality, security, and privacy. Working with a cloud provider can help streamline this process by ensuring IP security and freeing your network Data and AI can transform traditional decision-making processes. GenAI advancements are supercharging the way we handle unstructured data in every aspect of our lives. AI and alternative data will revolutionise traditional decision-making processes. The panel I attended discussed the many practical applications of GenAI. One example is in economics, where, traditionally, governments release data based on surveys of manufacturers. But now AI can interpret satellite data and maps showing the state of supply chains in real time. We can also introduce other data sets that AI has assessed, like what’s being purchased, for example, ultimately providing the shopping mall, or whichever business, with a clearer picture of economic activity. There are obvious business applications to this strand of GenAI, as well as insights for policymaking and accelerating progress towards the sustainable development goals. Essentially, the more data we have, the faster and more effective our decision-making will be. Developing an AI-first architecture to be in lockstep with the GenAI revolution. For business leaders on the precipice of the GenAI revolution, and trying to decide whether to build or buy, it’s important to understand that the journey will likely have many twists and turns. We at TCS believe in an AI-first architecture, where GenAI and its models are layered on top of existing enterprise IT systems and ultimately augment them. That’s not to say the task is easy, but for those who keep an open mind, work with the right partners and are prepared to overcome the challenges, the rewards will be transformational.

The future of enterprise lies in building resilient, responsible, and agile operations through continuous innovation. Knowledge is at the root of innovation for growth. With GenAI’s arrival, the potential now exists to make the major leap from a data-driven to a knowledge-driven enterprise. Everyone is focusing, however, on the technology’s more obvious automation efficiency benefits and debating its potential to displace jobs. We believe that GenAI tools will not only extend these efficiency benefits but also empower an organization’s talent to become exponentially more effective through the digitization and harmonization of knowledge—tacit knowledge in particular. Addressing a big gap in traditional knowledge systems, GenAI offers the power to transform the use of knowledge in every part of a business and across every industry. Knowledge workers, irrespective of their experience and skill level, can leverage knowledge as a formalized capability to deliver elite outcomes. GenAI has essentially handed over the keys to the knowledge kingdom, enabling businesses to discover and harness enterprise knowledge at unprecedented speed and scale for tremendous value creation. DR. HARRICK VIN Recent advances in generative large language models (LLMs), like Open AI’s Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), Anthropic Claude 2, and Meta Llama2, have catapulted AI automation with exceptional human-like capabilities. GenAI tools can therefore be used to do the brilliant work of performing knowledge-intensive tasks that are critical to driving top-line business growth and innovation. Moreover, they can help synthesize and make sense of a vast world of knowledge beyond the capabilities of any ordinary human being. “GenAI has essentially handed over the keys to the knowledge kingdom, enabling businesses to discover and harness enterprise knowledge at unprecedented speed and scale for tremendous value creation,” says Dr. Harrick Vin, Chief Technology Officer, TCS. “Early adopters who lead the way in becoming a knowledge-driven enterprise will unlock the potential to reign over their industries.” GenAI can augment human abilities with the power of greater knowledge to perform at higher levels. Throughout the information revolution era, enterprise knowledge systems have grown rapidly—progressing from vast repositories of codified data to information, insights, and intelligence. All the while, enterprise tacit knowledge—that uniquely human ability to intuitively understand something—has also been growing. Organizations rely heavily on tacit knowledge and manual processing activities to draw insightful connections across their enterprise for generating new ideas, making countless business decisions, and translating those decisions into actions. Acquired over time through contextualized experience and skills development, an organization’s tacit knowledge is generally concentrated among a few key individuals who hold that knowledge primarily in their heads and not in any readily codifiable form for access. When the input of these more knowledgeable individuals is needed to solve complex business problems or to make numerous business decisions, they tend to become the choking points. Digitizing tacit knowledge is the biggest opportunity for competitive advantage. SANKARANARAYANAN “SHANKY” VISWANATHAN GenAI tools can serve as supportive AI colleagues to these key individuals—without any codification required. Helping people easily access and contextualize the collective knowledge across an organization, augmenting their abilities, and providing them with essential guidance can reduce performance variability and drive overall better business outcomes with increased certainty. Organizations can thereby boost their productivity, inspire continuous innovation, improve speed to market, and deliver an enhanced customer experience. “Digitizing tacit knowledge is the biggest opportunity for competitive advantage,” says Sankaranarayanan “Shanky” Viswanathan, Vice President and Head of Strategic Business Initiatives, Corporate Technology Office, TCS. Empowered with such access to a digitized knowledge capability and personalized augmentation, enterprises can completely reimagine better ways of working while sparing their people from drudgery. Mundane tasks can be replaced by those of a higher order of value through the seamless interplay of humans and machines. By integrating GenAI with information and operational technology systems, organizations can tap the power of tacit knowledge as a formalized capability. Organizations can support ingenuity and facilitate more effective and efficient decision-making across an enterprise, from a help desk agent addressing a customer’s concerns to a product manager focused on a new product launch or the CFO responsible for risk management. For instance, a lot of product managers make positioning, pricing, and channel-related decisions based on heuristics and what has worked in the past. Imagine how their strategic decision-making capabilities could be significantly enhanced through GenAI. By leveraging an LLM for recommendations based on enterprise-specific and broader world-contextualized information, a product could be more effectively positioned to help maximize adoption. Figure 1: An infographic depicting the digitization and harmonization of knowledge in an organization through three structured levels of capability. The first or bottom level comprises enterprise data sources (including systems of record, value chains, data lakes and warehouses, and unstructured data repositories) and public data sources (including unstructured data repositories). The second or middle level comprises insights derived using traditional analytics and AI techniques along with tacit knowledge made accessible through an LLM that is pre-trained world-wise and fine-tuned enterprise-wise. The third or top level comprises enterprise decisions and actions. In effect, traditional analytic and AI insights (fueled by enterprise data sources) enhanced with tacit knowledge (fueled by enterprise and public data sources via an LLM) can drive enterprise decisions and actions for increased effectiveness as an overall formalized capability. In effect, businesses have been handed a monumental opportunity to disrupt their entire value chain from data to knowledge. Based on research by McKinsey & Company, GenAI could transform a wide range of business functions but especially “customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development,” potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value across industries.1 Over the next five years, S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts revenues for GenAI offerings will grow from $3.7 billion in 2023 to $36 billion by 2028 at a compound annual growth rate of 58%.2 By enhancing complex problem-solving capabilities, generative LLMs can help drive higher-quality business outcomes with consistency. Quality control is essentially a matter of consistency vs. variability. Consider, for instance, why people try to find an experienced plumber or electrician to solve a problem in their home. Because the quality of workmanship can vary widely, especially the more complex the problem, skilled labor offers consistency in the face of variable outcomes. The same variability in outcomes can be observed in an enterprise customer support center. Despite all the automated information support provided, a help desk agent still requires some degree of tacit knowledge to address the specific needs of one customer to another. Imagine how problem-solving capabilities across an enterprise could be improved if agents could tap a continually updated knowledge base with a dynamic capability for contextualizing it to their specific needs. Now consider a scenario where a shop floor mechanic is tasked with troubleshooting a turbine with a vibration problem arising from a multitude of potential causes. IoT sensors installed on the turbine could help automatically detect and convey real-time, contextual information about the problem. Supported by a vast ecosystem of knowledge, the mechanic doesn’t need to be the company’s top expert to diagnose and fix the problem. Through the GenAI ecosystem, they can leverage the collective experience captured over time from all mechanics across the enterprise. Inspecting a turbine with the support of a knowledge ecosystem An LLM, integrated with a company’s systems, can be used to auto-generate guided instructions on how to effectively diagnose and repair or replace suspect parts. Detailed information about the inner workings of a turbine could be provided through augmented reality which overlays a digital twin of the turbine. This scenario could be further enhanced with a metaverse solution that provides a more immersive virtual capability. The intelligent guided assistance provided is all about enabling an organization’s fleet of mechanics to deliver consistently high performance by eliminating variability in troubleshooting and solving complex problems. This type of scenario, combining the use of GenAI with associated digital technologies, can translate across industries and is within reach today. Where TCS sees the greatest impact for enterprise GenAI is in areas with a high amount of knowledge concentration. Looking across the value chain, the opportunities best suited for using GenAI are where there are either repetitive knowledge-intensive tasks being performed by a lot of people with variability or a few key experts with discretionary thinking. The spectrum of opportunities is wide-ranging—with the potential for value realization increasing from knowledge discovery through business function optimization and personalized augmentation. While the potential uses for GenAI continue to explode, we believe the truly transformative business value will be achieved as organizations advance their use of GenAI for personalized augmentation. Through increased human and AI collaboration, new symbiotic relationships will emerge. With their immense contextual awareness, GenAI assistants can serve as specialized copilots and thereby elevate the role of humans to perform at higher, more strategic levels. Figure 2: An infographic depicting a spectrum of enterprise GenAI opportunities advancing through three stages of value realization. The first stage, knowledge discovery, encompasses knowledge summarization, extraction, and classification. The second stage, business function optimization, focuses on driving improved effectiveness through appropriate assistance and automation. The third and highest stage, personalized augmentation, leverages the help of specialist copilots for orchestrating work with contextual awareness. The truly transformative business value will be achieved when organizations advance their use of GenAI through the personalized augmentation stage. Organizations can effectively use GenAI to reshape their workstreams, automating time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks, and then augmenting their human talent with scarcer knowledge capabilities. They can boost overall productivity across their core business functions by, for instance: Providing real-time, contextualized knowledge to support strategic and financial decision-making. Strengthening organizational capabilities through more tailored and engaging recruiting and employee training programs. Better anticipating market needs and providing customers with hyper-personalized product and service offerings through enhanced research capabilities. Inspiring innovation through AI-generated ideas and streamlining product development lifecycles for speed to market. Leveraging autonomous chatbots for frontline customer support and enriching the knowledge of human agents to address more advanced problem-solving needs. The potential opportunities to leverage GenAI also extend to verticalized capabilities like drug discovery and development, health diagnosis and monitoring, investment advisory for banking, and risk profiling for insurance. There are limitless opportunities to shape new revenue streams, ways of engaging with customers, and delivery mechanisms for products and services. When it comes to GenAI adoption, the big question is not a matter of if, but how and can it be done right now? Start small or go big? Is it a wiser bet for businesses to take an incremental use case-driven approach, or will they lose the opportunity for competitive advantage by not placing a bigger bet on GenAI? Because GenAI is in its infancy, businesses are challenged to understand the overall investment cost and business impact. Companies should consider that adopting GenAI in isolation may have its flashy moment but is likely to be much less impactful and fleeting in value. To maximize ROI, GenAI should be considered in the broader context of the overall value chain, identifying the areas of high knowledge concentration, picking the right opportunity to focus on, and then doing it right for a greater multiplier effect. An otherwise bottom-up approach, driven by individual project teams with a proof-of-concept (POC) mindset, is apt to result in implementation fatigue, risk proliferation, and disillusionment. To effectively and safely scale a GenAI POC for enterprise use, guardrails must be established (learn more). Decisions surrounding GenAI adoption should also not be limited to the CIO. Input from the entire C-suite is essential, as a variety of factors across core business functions must be addressed. For example, concerns over how people’s jobs may change, whether they will be automated, and opportunities for reskilling should be addressed with care. From an overall technology architecture standpoint, companies that lead with an AI-first, cloud-based approach will be in the best position to optimize the synergies between GenAI and cloud computing … SIVA GANESAN Businesses stand to realize a much greater investment return through a top-down strategic and calibrated approach that integrates all aspects of the operation, from technology and processes to people—and the cloud can provide the foundation for a connected future. No longer seen as a one-dimensional IT infrastructure, the cloud can serve as the unifying digital fabric that unfolds and expands with new technological advancements like GenAI to enable continued growth and innovation (learn more).3 Through our vision, we see the enterprise of the future as AI-first by design with generative LLMs foundational in their construction along with data warehouses (DWHs) and data lakes, and fully integrated with information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems. “From an overall technology architecture standpoint, companies that lead with an AI-first, cloud-based approach will be in the best position to optimize the synergies between GenAI and cloud computing to enable new and better ways of working and drive truly transformative business value,” says Siva Ganesan, Global Head, TCS AI.Cloud. Reimagining ways of working (WoW) and augmenting systems with advanced knowledge capabilities will empower employees to perform at a higher level and drive consistent business outcomes for customers. Orchestrating the work through an intermediary layer of autonomous AI agents tasked with verifying and governing user interactions with LLMs can help ensure their responsible use across the enterprise. Figure 3: An infographic depicting an AI-first architecture consisting of four tiers: 1) At the first or bottom tier, the existing core enterprise IT and OT systems include computing, network, data storage, digital products and platforms, and systems of record. 2) At the second tier, foundational LLM, DWH, and data lakes include structured data stores, unstructured data, external data stores, analytics, and insights; third-party and partner-provided; and open source. 3) At the third tier, purposive and contextual task agents include creating and tuning models; setting up guardrails; and observing, learning, and adapting. 4) At the fourth or top tier, AI-augmented work systems include intelligent orchestration of purposive tasks with human-in-the-loop. The overall focus is on reimagining ways of working and “jobs to be done” to drive new value for customers through the top three tiers. The left side of the infographic shows the multitiered architecture of future AI-first businesses as key to creating market differentiation. The right side of the graphic explains that the top two tiers may include custom; and AI engineering and systems integration. To extract the greatest value, this AI-first approach should be industry- and domain-specific, make the most of cloud computing investments, leverage the power of a continually evolving and expanding technology ecosystem, and ultimately seek to create a knowledge superstructure to optimize the use of developed knowledge. Toward this end, a comprehensive implementation strategy should encompass: Creating an overall blueprint to drive enterprise transformation across the value chain by assessing and prioritizing high-value areas of opportunity. Integrating LLMs with IT and OT systems to facilitate storage and processing of knowledge across an enterprise as well as for use with physical processes and machines on the shop floor. Fine-tuning the model to make it relevant to an enterprise’s domain and optimize the potential business benefits. Making the model safe to use for employees by establishing information security, regulatory compliance, and bias mitigation guardrails with the integration of an AI agent-based layer for policy enforcement. Training the organization to adopt new ways of working and effectively (and safely) operationalizing the model. When it comes to operationalizing GenAI, many companies are naturally concerned about security risks but also the potential for biased responses. The use of enterprise GenAI, however, offers the opportunity to establish ethical guardrails and eliminate the risk of bias as a whole, whereas you can’t put the same guardrails on actual humans. In effect, the technology can support an organization’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. With GenAI technology evolving rapidly amid many unknowns, industry leaders are racing to understand the full scope of opportunities. What is readily clear is that businesses of all walks have an unprecedented opportunity to realize the transformative value of becoming a knowledge-driven enterprise. To seize a competitive advantage and drive growth, companies need to start turning a strategic plan into action today. 1 McKinsey Digital; McKinsey & Company; The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier; Jun 14, 2023; https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-AI-the-next-productivity-frontier#introduction; Accessed Dec 28, 2023 2 S&P Global Market Intelligence; Generative AI Software Market Forecast to Expand Near 10 Times by 2028 to $36 Billion, S&P Global Market Intelligence Says; Jun 8, 2023; https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/media-center/press-release/generative-ai-software-market-forecast-to-expand-near-10-times-by-2028-to-36-billion-sp-global-market-intelligence-says; Accessed Dec 28, 2023 3 TCS Global Cloud Study 2023; Connected future: How cloud drives business innovation; Aug 18, 2023; https://www.tcs.com/insights/global-studies/tcs-global-cloud-study; Accessed Dec 28, 2023 From potential to performance by design Shaping the future through responsible AI adoption TCS AI WisdomNext™ TCS launches an industry-first GenAI aggregation platform: TCS AI WisdomNext™ Theme Font size Line height",https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/pace-innovation/article/generative-ai-knowledge-driven-enterprise

Abstract The financial services industry has always been at the forefront of embracing new technological innovations to keep pace with the changing business ecosystem. Generative AI (GenAI) is no exception to this trend. The advent of GenAI offers valuable opportunities to enhance productivity in financial services. That said, there are differing views on both sides of the spectrum, spanning acceptance as well as opposition to adoption. We believe that a cautious approach is the right way forward. We highlight areas where GenAI can be leveraged in the finance space to improve key functions of the chief financial officer’s (CFO) office. Art of the possible GenAI comes with superior learning models and the ability to assimilate complex content and produce insights that mimic human intelligence and knowledge. It opens up a plethora of opportunities to resolve complex problems and conduct repetitive tasks with an enhanced degree of precision. Its capabilities go beyond what is offered by existing robotic process automation (RPA) and machine learning (ML) technologies. GenAI models can be continuously trained to learn and relearn, which enhances their learning capacity multi-fold. In contrast, RPA and ML have limited learn, auto-learn, and relearn capabilities as the benefits realized through them tend to plateau over a period of time. Compared with other data crunching tools, GenAI has a higher capacity to consume huge amounts of data and deliver value-generating insights and greatly improve the quality of decision-making in the financial services industry. How GenAI helps CFOs Several CFO-centric business functions can benefit immensely from GenAI. Given that the finance function is laser focused on profitability, margins, and costs, GenAI has the potential to complement CFOs in achieving these priorities. Balance sheet management and profitability: CFOs of financial institutions must factor in multiple conflicting parameters and criteria while finalizing the balance sheet. GenAI enables finance teams to consume large swathes of market data that is used in balance sheet planning and extract insights and synthesize data for better decision-making. With pretrained parameters, GenAI can learn and generate insights at speeds and precision that existing technologies cannot match. Consequently, CFOs can get timely access to superior insights without spending time on extracting them, thereby empowering them to make smart decisions. Profit and loss and balance sheet substantiation: Analyzing trade level transactions and performing variance analysis on different parameters such as price fluctuation, deal level profitability, intra-day profit or loss, and end-of-day valuations require review of multiple documents covering deal data, trade level transactions, Greeks, and so on. Currently, this process involves manual intervention, compromising accuracy. GenAI can read through troves of background content and leverage large language models (LLMs) as well as pre-trained and proprietary models to synthesize highly accurate commentary, eliminating human intervention so that business teams only need to scrutinize the final commentary. Financial risk management: The CFO function of financial institutions monitors exposure and deposit concentration and oversees compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Basel regulations. GenAI tools can scan market reports and perform sentiment analysis on news feeds and read through regulatory text and summarize findings. More importantly, the tools can suggest alternatives to mitigate concentration risk in the existing credit portfolio. This will help flag events that need immediate attention and alert business teams to initiate action. The US Fed’s stress tests do not factor in select scenarios such as an increasing interest rate regime, percentage of uninsured deposits over the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) limit of US$ 250,000, and banks holding a larger amount of treasury bills in the held-to-maturity (HTM) bucket. As a result, aspects such as deposit concentration and maturity mismatch are not factored into stress tests. In our view, this combined with regulators’ failure to foresee the potential of such excluded scenarios to trigger a crisis is one of the reasons for recent bank failures in the US. Existing technologies lack the capability to extract the requisite data from banks’ systems to run such new scenarios. Deploying GenAI can help simulate such scenarios and potentially avert a future crisis. Treasury operations: Treasury division functions such as investment planning, funds transfer pricing (FTP), and nostro-vostro reconciliation involve research of different sources of information. Existing processes are largely manual, and significant time and effort are expended to perform treasury operations. Consequently, time available to analyze, review, and take the right decision is limited. Armed with pre-trained models and the ability to assimilate large data sets, GenAI delivers accurate, predictive insights to treasurers for decision-making, eliminating time spends on manually reading reports and drawing insights. SOX compliance: Corporate failures and fraud resulting in massive financial losses led to the introduction of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act in 2002. The objective was to improve risk management and governance. An independent audit board, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), was formed to scrutinize the audits conducted by banks and prescribe corrective action. However, compliance is complex and still poses challenges. Internal financial controls mandated by SOX involve review of troves of financial documents, process manuals, standard operating procedures, checklists, and so on to assess financial controls. Traditional tools and technologies have many pitfalls, owing to which SOX, internal financial controls, and audit processes in banks are imperfect. With its ability to assimilate large swathes of data, GenAI can help the CFO function to overcome challenges in traditional methods, deliver superior outcomes, ensure efficient monitoring, and achieve effective regulatory compliance. The way forward GenAI is memory intensive and requires heavy compute power. This means existing pretrained models may not be suitable. Financial institutions will have to make significant investments in compute infrastructure and training data repositories to deploy Gen AI technology. We believe that banks must tread cautiously in identifying training data sets and finetuning the existing commercially available models that would be a part of the GenAI ecosystem. Before embarking on implementation, CFOs will need to resolve some key questions. Another point to be noted is that finetuning existing models comes with the risk of harmful training outcomes and the potential for inadvertent biases in model training. The solution lies in creating proprietary data sets to train models, adopting a cautious approach to finetuning pre-trained models, building industry consensus on how to use GenAI, and nudging industry bodies to ensure ethical use. In addition, training must be tailored to specific functional domain(s) encompassing trillions of parameters, diverse asset classes, and data taxonomies. Human oversight is key to ensuring that errors and omissions with the potential for biased decisions are eliminated—this responsibility cannot be delegated to a machine. A human being in the CFO function needs to be held accountable for the consequences of inadvertent errors and omissions. GenAI is a classic example of technology outpacing regulations—there are as yet no regulations to govern GenAI adoption and use in the financial services industry. Given the ambiguity, financial institutions must self-regulate, building consortiums to define guidelines. They must voluntarily comply with the guidelines till regulations eventually catch up with industry readiness to explore and embrace GenAI. Bank CFOs must keep in mind that they cannot drive the conversation on reaping the benefits of GenAI on their own. As with every big initiative, industry and rule-making bodies must collaborate, which needs a concerted effort from lawmakers, elected representatives, industry bodies, and banks. In light of the above, we recommend that financial institutions adopt a use case-based approach and run proofs of concept (PoCs) to check if ideas can be transformed into workable prototypes that deliver business value. The learnings from the PoCs can be leveraged to determine if GenAI technology should be pursued for other use cases. Having said that, use cases will continue to evolve, and arriving at a consensus will require multiple iterations. Further, regulations on data localization, privacy, and hosting as well as geography-specific privacy laws must be borne in mind while building utilities or backend software using GenAI technologies. CFOs must consider inputs from the CIO and CTO functions on the most relevant and suitable use cases. They must then formulate a cross-functional task force to embrace GenAI and deal with the change management ramifications. The GenAI utility must not be given the autonomy to make decisions—human judgment must inform the final decision. GenAI is not a silver bullet that will resolve all business challenges that CFOs grapple with. However, some financial institutions have embraced GenAI in a limited way for their day-to-day internal activities, running pilots for specific use cases to determine if large scale adoption is feasible. As CFOs explore new technologies to reimagine the finance function, they must keep track of how Gen AI evolves. Once adoption picks up pace, quick action will be needed to forge ahead of the competition.

New world order The COVID-19 pandemic led to businesses reimagining the work, the worker, and the workplace. As with any other industry, this has resulted in telecommunications companies focusing on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. According to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol – the global accounting standard for greenhouse emissions – telcos have reasonably navigated Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions from energy sources). Scope 3 emissions, that are not associated with the operator itself but which the organization is indirectly responsible for, are harder to track. A significant part of Scope 3 emissions come from the workplace. The ESG framework assesses how an organization can nurture its workforce and empower its human capital amidst rapidly changing environmental, social, and economic systems. Creating sustainable workplaces is now a critical requirement for communications service providers (CSPs) in their journey toward net zero. Rethink workplaces Environmental and social factors are key to transforming telcos’ sustainability strategies. The global energy crisis, increased pressure from stakeholders, and the emergence of new digital technologies are additional stimuli for communications and media firms to transform their ESG strategies. These include tracking greenhouse gas emissions, finding a solution for the energy consumption of end-of-life equipment, and dealing with the challenges of a global customer base. CSPs can now consciously connect people and organizations to their digital society, increasing transparency and building effective dialogue without compromising on ethics and integrity. Become sustainable Rethink how workplaces are utilized, create space for social responsibility, and ensure a healthy governance system. Telcos need to become centers for promoting teamwork through skill workshops and social and creative exchange. For a sustainable workplace, telcos should take a holistic approach by: Lead the way Keeping Scope 3 emissions under check is essential to integrate ESG principles into a telco’s ecosystem. By optimizing the supply chain to allow for circularity, agreeing to equipment-as-a-service, making sustainability a critical evaluation benchmark during procurement, and working with suppliers to reduce their Scope 3 emissions, telcos can incorporate ESG principles into their ecosystems. Additionally, telcos should: An organization with a highly engaged workforce will report a high ESG maturity, leading to positive reinforcement from the entire ecosystem. Telcos must lead in creating a sustainable workplace that protects against further harm to biodiversity and climate change while enhancing employee well-being. Such a working environment will bring in new talent, thereby contributing to the overall sustainability of the business.

Introduction Capital market firms operate in a complex and ever-changing technology landscape. At the same time, they must contend with increased regulatory scrutiny, competition from fintech players and the crypto industry, soaring operational and service costs, increased customer expectations, black swan events and so on. Firms need to constantly adapt to stay ahead of the curve, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as generative AI (GenAI) have become a key enabler in this strategic play. In recent months, GenAI has garnered interest from various financial services firms after the launch of ChatGPT, which is powered by large language models (LLMs). GenAI can combine with AI and human intelligence to create content such as text and images and solve complex analytical problems. GenAI in capital markets GenAI finds relevance in capital markets in particular as domain-specific tools are readily available. While tools such as ChatGPT are generic across domains, vertical-specific LLM-based tools are gaining popularity as they offer better accuracy. Domain-specific models perform significantly better than open models on specific tasks without compromising performance on general LLM benchmarks. BloombergGPT is an example of a domain-specific model relevant for capital markets. However, open models outperform domain-specific models in general tasks. In capital markets, domain-specific models are useful in classifying news, preparing and filing regulatory reports, retrieving company-specific information, and creating research reports on companies. We examine a few areas where GenAI can be leveraged in the capital markets space. Wealth management Clients of wealth management firms expect personalized advice, presenting a dilemma to firms, which are under pressure to reduce customer service costs. Financial advisors can benefit from a recommendation engine built using LLMs. LLMs can be leveraged to draw insights from unstructured data such as research reports, regulatory filings, and images. GenAI can summarize data from many sources quickly and accurately and generate content for financial advisors and investors much faster than existing systems. Trading Electronic trading systems execute trades using algorithms and defined trading strategies. GenAI can enable financial services firms to summarize information required for trading in real time, thereby reducing execution time. Additionally, it can rapidly analyze vast amounts of historical data and trends to predict short- and near-term price movements based on news and economic indicators. Further, it can generate customized technical and fundamental indicators for making buy or sell decisions. From an algorithmic trading perspective, users can leverage GenAI to create bots that can automatically place orders based on personalized trading rules. Customer engagement Backed by extended reality (XR), an LLM-powered digital assistant can read facial features as well as analyze customer emotions in real time and adjust the tone of the conversation. Such assistants can help humanize digital customer interactions and deliver an immersive, contextual experience, in turn strengthening customer relationships. Investment banking research GenAI can help summarize news articles and financial reports of a specific company and generate economic summaries of industries relevant to investment targets. When trained on historical market data along with key economic parameters (such as inflation, interest rate, energy prices, news), it can help firms forecast market trends. Investment advisors and their clients can instantly access stock recommendations without paying hefty subscription charges for research reports. Fraud and compliance management Capital market firms can improve their ability to detect and report financial crimes to regulators and enhance overall compliance and risk management efforts. LLMs can be deployed to identify suspicious transactions in exchanges. Further, GenAI tools can be used to prepare accurate suspicious activity reports (SARs) in real time with lesser human effort. They can also be used for the review of contract documents during onboarding with lesser effort and at a higher accuracy, which improves compliance. Risk management GenAI has the potential to improve the effectiveness of risk management in capital markets through synthetic data or data that is artificially generated rather than produced by real-world events. Synthetic data has emerged as a popular tool for risk management experts to overcome the limitations of historical data and access a full range of stress scenarios. GenAI can greatly enhance risk controls by identifying fraudulent transactions in order books of stock exchanges using synthetic data, preventing insider trading and supporting anti-money laundering (AML) measures. Concerns plaguing GenAI GenAI has immense potential to disrupt capital markets in the analytics and advisory areas. ChatGPT can enhance productivity by playing the role of a co-pilot to researchers, traders, and compliance specialists. End-customer experience too will improve significantly through smarter chatbots and transparent interactions. However, GenAI has raised questions around transparency, data security, fundamental rights, and fake news leading to social tensions. Additionally, concerns such as fear of job loss, data privacy, and lack of enterprise offerings will also need to be addressed effectively. This will demand collaboration among stakeholders such as governments, regulators, and capital market firms to accelerate the adoption of GenAI in capital markets. The way forward In our view, GenAI adoption will occur gradually given skepticism and apprehensions in the absence of comprehensive regulations. However, we believe that capital markets firms must invest in the requisite assets, frameworks, and talent needed to explore the possibility of running proofs-of-concept (PoC) to assess the feasibility of large-scale adoption. As they do this, they must also keep abreast of the developments in the GenAI space because once the technology becomes mainstream, firms will need to hit the ground running to gain a lead. 5G and Cloud Edge are Breaking the Barrier to Decision-making in Capital Markets Fostering a sustainable workplace: How CSPs can achieve net-zero goals Quantitative modelling and analysis and its role in finance DeFi: Enabling Seamless Finance Transformation and Process Efficiency Theme Font size Line height",https://www.tcs.com/insights/blogs/generative-ai-capital-markets

The ability to automate knowledge processing quickly and at scale has arrived. GenAI, an advanced form of machine learning powered by LLMs, has ushered in a bold new era in computing. The potential of GenAI has been demonstrated by the technology’s ability to generate new and customized content quickly and at scale. Examples include the generation of code, text, images, lyrics, musical compositions, and even videos. The benefit of GenAI is that it’s all done without any human input. Not only can this technology save valuable time and effort, but it frees up human resources to focus on more complicated problems like achieving goals and driving outcomes. A type of LLM, generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) are designed for natural language processing. OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and the more powerful GPT-4, as well as Google’s PaLM, are examples of these models, which have been pre-trained on large datasets. These LLMs generate responses that are often difficult to distinguish from those written by humans. Since models are pre-trained, they allow enterprises to quickly build new capabilities. Optimizing the benefit of LLMs, however, requires the fine-tuning of models to make them more relevant to an enterprise’s domain, along with setting guardrails to make LLMs safe for use by employees. So how can this best be accomplished? By leveraging a framework that optimizes the use of LLMs with autonomous AI agents, businesses can unleash the possibilities of GenAI while helping to ensure responsible usage across an enterprise. The implications are significant for a wide range of industries—this approach supports activities from technical design and marketing to product discovery and engineering, customer service, and data analysis. AI has seen many false dawns, resulting in widespread AI fatigue. But recent advances in generative AI, with large language models such as GPT, PaLM, and Claude coming along, demonstrate that the potential is now reality. Narendran Sivakumar LLMs represent a significant leap in AI evolution, demonstrating an ability to generate knowledge in the form of content that is not only coherent but also creative and engaging, whether the results are technical documents, engineering designs, or even new product ideas. But because they are generic pre-trained models, domain and sub-domain adaptations of LLMs are a prerequisite in making them relevant for enterprise usage. A calibrated approach for fine-tuning and better prompt engineering is needed to maintain an LLM’s relevance. Enabling a calibrated training strategy For domain and sub-domain adaptations, LLMs must be either fine-tuned or pre-trained from scratch, depending on use cases and user scenarios. In the case of fine-tuning, enterprises can embrace four different training approaches: Combined fine-tuning: An enterprise prepares relevant data, driven by use cases, in a specific format as required by the selected LLM. Because this approach lumps domain, sub-domain, and transactional data into one corpus, model learning is largely restricted to use case scenarios, as opposed to staggered learning, where the model becomes domain-aware before becoming enterprise-aware. Phased: Addressing the domain learning limitations of combined fine-tuning, this approach imposes a fine-tuning sequence. The focus is on building domain awareness in a model before going deeper into sub-domains and context. Domain and task-adapted: This approach is critical for use cases and user scenarios where a model’s performance and differentiated outcomes need to be more responsive than a traditional pre-trained or fine-tuned model. It entails expanding the pre-training envelope to include a domain-specific and task-specific data corpus, in addition to a generic open data corpus, for pre-training. Fine-tuning to optimize enterprise outcomes A good training regimen does not guarantee enterprise outcomes. Post-fine-tuning optimization is essential to align an LLM to enterprise needs and drive desired outcomes. To address the structural limitations created by involuntary bias injection, which can plague an LLM’s response, newer optimization strategies, from reinforcement learning with human feedback to reward-based models and low-rank adaptations, are critical. These strategies can align an LLM to enterprise demands of ""mostly consistent"" truthfulness, reliability of responses, and repeatability under the same context and user scenarios. Eliminate variability by design An LLM is only as good as the prompts used to elicit a response. Enterprises must embark on large-scale business change programs to train organization members on prompting. Because prompting is part art and part science. However, even the best training can’t eliminate variability. It also depends on how well employees are deploying prompting techniques to realize desired outcomes. To remove variability in responses, enterprises can build a library of prompts and chained prompts with defined purposes, which can be selected and deployed by employees with minor enhancements. This approach not only eliminates variability but also helps standardize user scenarios. By leveraging an agent-based modeling framework, this approach can be extended, eliminating the need for human prompting altogether. Such an approach can help automate prompting, allowing enterprises to govern and constrain (if required) end-user interactions, with codified enterprise policies and guardrails. There are multiple training strategies to get the best out of LLMs. An infographic depicting four types of prompt engineering training strategies to reduce variability in responses, including phased, integrated, deep, and fast. The phased training strategy, the most comprehensive option designed for domain-centric enterprise use cases, includes pre-training, domain adaptation, sub-domain adaptation, and optimization. The integrated training strategy, designed for generic and less-domain intensive use cases, includes pre-training, combined fine-tuning, and optimization. The deep training strategy, designed for business-critical, proprietary, and high-value enterprise use cases, includes domain and task-adapted pre-training, sub-domain adaptation, and optimization. The fast training strategy, the most streamlined option designed for demonstrations and proof of technologies, includes just pre-training and optimization. How can we leverage the promise of AI in a safe manner? While the generative capabilities of LLMs offer immense potential, they also present organizations with a new set of challenges that must be addressed. The open-ended nature of these models means they can produce outputs that may not align with an organization’s requirements, policies, or ethical guidelines. Without a set of safety controls or guardrails in place for governance, there is a real risk of generating inappropriate, biased, or misleading content that can harm an organization’s reputation, or violate regulatory and legal obligations. Putting up guardrails is essential to ensure the responsible and secure usage of generative LLMs across the enterprise by defining the boundaries within which they may operate. Organizations can leverage the creative potential of GenAI technology while maintaining control over outcomes—you don’t have to enable one aspect at the expense of others. The guardrails approach for LLMs arises from three key areas of business need to: Enforce policies for their use. Enhance their contextual understanding. Support their ability to continuously adapt. By implementing guardrails, enterprises can harness the power of LLMs while safeguarding against security breaches, compliance violations, and ethical concerns. These guardrails serve as guidelines to shape the behavior of the models, allowing organizations to build generative capabilities on a foundation of trust. Organizations are thereby empowered to channel their new capabilities in a controlled and responsible manner. Various routes to create GenAI guardrails While the need for guardrails is readily apparent, the route an enterprise should take to implement them is not so clear. There are broadly four possible routes an enterprise can take to create foolproof guardrails around GenAI: Building enterprise-specific LLMs on trusted information sources: Taking this route is easier said than done. Pre-training LLMs from scratch and subsequently fine-tuning them, although effective in preventing obvious risks around bias and toxicity, requires massive investments in computing infrastructure. Even then, outcomes are not likely to be completely free of bias and toxicity. The risks around security, data protection, and variability in model responses remain unaddressed—these risks are inherent in LLMs. Optimizing LLMs for enterprise policies and technology guardrails: This route entails augmenting LLMs with advanced optimization techniques, such as reward-based models, reinforcement learning with human feedback, or low-rank adaptations. These techniques are not just governed by generic rules of bias elimination, toxicity detection, and improving hallucinations like the ones prevalent in the latest GPT or PaLM models. In addition, enterprises can leverage these optimization techniques on tailor-made rules and policies that are unique to an industry and enterprise context. Although promising, the closed nature of these techniques makes them hard to implement on commonly used LLMs. Red teaming, using a manual, human-driven verification, and assurance capability: With this route, the model is verified and checked for all possible vulnerabilities and risks. This is a slow and very expensive process that is only useful for identifying vulnerabilities in an LLM. Fixing those vulnerabilities would entail subsequent fine-tuning and optimizations, if possible. Augmenting LLMs with agent-based models as verifier and governor: This route recognizes the complexity of an enterprise while focusing on creating an automated LLM verifier and governor. Enterprises today have varying degrees of complexity, and their resultant policies, including risk mitigations and optimizations, will invariably become less effective over time. Instead of focusing on making LLMs safe for an enterprise, agent-based modeling can be used to verify and govern all LLM interactions. Even if the underlying LLMs are not safe, the use of agent-based models can help an enterprise ensure its interactions are safe as well as outcome-oriented. Among these potential routes for making GenAI and LLMs safe for enterprise use, the best-suited and more viable option is agent-based modeling. By augmenting LLMs with agent-based models, enterprises can enforce technology and security guardrails for all GenAI interactions. Enabling wide use of generative AI is a three-way balancing act between inventiveness, consistency, and security. To embrace this technology and access its potential, an organization’s members need to trust it. Sankaranarayanan ""Shanky"" Viswanathan Letting AI agents do the work Automation meets creation. Combining LLMs with, for instance, an agent-based modeling framework opens new possibilities for the development of an autonomous AI agent ecosystem. Intelligent agents, powered by LLMs, can work collaboratively, adaptively, and autonomously in this ecosystem to realize user goals and outcomes for content creation without a heavy reliance on explicit prompt design and engineering by users. A shift in focus Traditionally, users have been responsible for designing prompts and providing explicit instructions to LLMs to obtain the desired outputs. This process requires domain expertise and can be time-consuming, limiting a user’s ability to explore the full potential of a model. With the introduction of agent-based models, the level of required expertise is significantly reduced. By incorporating AI agents into a framework, users can shift their focus from prompt design and engineering to defining goals and outcomes. The agents, equipped with the ability to understand user intents and interactions with LLMs, can take charge of formulating appropriate queries, seeking clarifications, and generating outputs aligned with user objectives. This outcome-driven approach enables users to engage more intuitively with the AI system, making it accessible to a broader range of users, including those without deep technical expertise. Collaboration and adaptation across an ecosystem Within an autonomous AI ecosystem, agents can collaborate and share knowledge to enhance their collective capabilities. Each agent can specialize in a specific domain or task, leveraging the expertise of LLMs in that area. By sharing insights, learned behaviors, and successful strategies, agents can collectively improve their performance and achieve better outcomes. These agent-based models also have the capability to adapt and learn from user interactions and feedback. As users interact with the system and provide guidance, agents can refine their understanding of user preferences, contextual nuances, and desired outcomes. This adaptive behavior enables the agents to deliver more personalized and accurate responses attuned to individual user needs over time. Role of agent-based models An agent-based modeling framework introduces a new approach to enhance the usage of LLMs by combining them with an agent-based layer. Computational in nature, agent-based models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous agents to analyze complex systems. With LLMs, an agent-based layer acts as a mediator between the user and the language model, facilitating controlled and guided interactions. Agent-based models bring several advantages: Policy enforcement: Enables the enforcement of policies and guardrails by defining rules, constraints, and guidelines for interactions with the language model. These policies can encompass security measures, compliance requirements, ethical guidelines, and other enterprise-specific regulations. Contextual understanding: Enhances the understanding of user queries and requests. By leveraging external data sources, user preferences, historical interactions, and other relevant information, agent-based models can provide a more accurate and context-aware input to the underlying language model, resulting in more relevant and reliable responses. Adaptive behavior: Learns and adapts over time. Agent-based models can incorporate machine learning techniques to analyze user feedback, improve their understanding of user intents, and dynamically adjust the policies and guardrails based on evolving enterprise needs and changing user requirements. Long-term memory management Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs typically possess a short-term memory, restricted to the context window of a few thousand words. They excel at processing and generating content based on recent context but may struggle to retain information over extended periods. This limitation poses challenges in maintaining coherent and consistent interactions with users, especially when dealing with multi-turn conversations or complex tasks requiring a broader context. An agent-based modeling framework addresses the short-term memory limitation of LLMs beyond the context window of a few thousand words by incorporating long-term memory management within the agent layer. Agents, acting as intermediaries between users and language models, can effectively maintain and recall contextual knowledge and user preferences across multiple interactions. Context preservation: Agents store and preserve relevant context from previous interactions, allowing for continuity in conversations and helping to ensure a more coherent understanding of user intents and requirements. This leads to more personalized and contextually relevant outputs. Learning from historical data: Agents enhance their understanding and decision-making capabilities by leveraging historical data. Through analyzing past interactions and outcomes, agents can identify patterns, learn from successful strategies, and adapt their behavior to better serve user goals. Knowledge integration: The agent layer acts as a knowledge repository, integrating information from various sources such as external data, domain-specific knowledge bases, and user-provided context. This aggregated knowledge becomes a valuable resource that agents can tap into to generate more comprehensive and accurate responses, even when the language model’s short-term memory alone might not suffice. Ring-fencing the language model In TCS’ approach, an agent-based layer acts as a ring-fence, separating the language model from direct interactions. Ring-fencing serves multiple purposes: Controlled interactions: By placing the language model behind an agent-based layer, organizations can ensure all their interactions with the model are channeled through defined policies and guardrails. This allows for fine-grained control over outputs, reducing the risk of generating content that does not comply with enterprise-specific guidelines. Security and privacy: Ring-fencing provides an additional layer of security, protecting an LLM from potential breaches and unauthorized access. It also helps preserve user privacy by preventing direct exposure of sensitive data to a language model. Flexible integration: The ring-fence approach allows for flexibility in integrating different LLMs within an agent-based framework. Organizations can choose the most suitable language models for their specific needs while maintaining a consistent interface and policy enforcement mechanism through the agent-based layer. Policies and controls An agent-based modeling framework provides the means for defining policies and enforcing controls to govern the behavior and outputs of underlying language models. These guardrails can address the specific requirements and constraints of an organization through: Policy customization: Organizations can define policies that align with their security, compliance, ethical, and operational requirements. These policies can address aspects such as content filtering, language constraints, sensitivity to specific topics, adherence to regulatory guidelines, or any other criteria deemed important by the organization. Compliance enforcement: Organizations can define policies to ensure that generated outputs comply with legal, regulatory, and industry-specific guidelines. Compliance measures include guarding against the dissemination of sensitive information, preventing the generation of discriminatory or biased content, and maintaining intellectual property rights. Dynamic updates: Organizations can update policies and guardrails dynamically as needs evolve. Policies can be modified and updated in real time, helping to ensure continuous compliance and adaptability to changing business environments. Key considerations for the deployment of agent-based models While agent-based models offer a well-suited approach to making GenAI and LLMs safe for enterprise use, the systems are quite complex to design and deploy. Before embarking on the approach, enterprises need to keep these key considerations in mind: Design an environment closer to enterprise reality for better performance: Agents are strictly bound by the environment design in which they operate. The environment, in this case, should be very close to how an enterprise operates and the outcomes it delivers. Model enterprise interactions and dynamics faithfully: Agent-based modeling needs to reflect enterprise user interactions with LLMs and the purpose those interactions are expected to serve. These dynamics are critical and need to be captured as part of guardrails for agent behavior. Provide dedicated training for agents and agent-based systems: Agent-based models are effective only if they are trained for defined tasks and policies. This training is not to be confused with the pre-training and fine-tuning regimen of LLMs. Optimize agents for enterprise-specific needs: Enterprises must calibrate their approaches based on industry and enterprise-specific requirements. Optimization techniques such as reward-based models or reinforcement-based learning techniques such as proximal policy optimization need to be carefully evaluated based on clear appreciation of their potential and impact on enterprise scenarios. It’s important to emphasize that not all optimization techniques will yield similar outcomes without careful evaluation and selection. Maintain consistency in policy definition for predictable agent performance: Policy design needs to be consistent and manageable. Inconsistencies or vagueness in policies would force agents off the rails and result in inexplicable behavior. Policies can be atomic, conditional, or nested, so long as the definitions are clear and unambiguous. Create a process to manage exceptions: Agents can and will fail. What matters more is how the failures are handled. Incorporating exception management routines for agent-based models is key in helping to ensure that agents fail gracefully—and with minimal enterprise impact. Integrate and extend to new frameworks for explainability and security: An overarching integration framework is essential to bring explainability and enterprise-specific solutions into the GenAI capability set. Instead of building and rebuilding capabilities that are not central to GenAI, a technology integration backbone allows enterprises to grow the ""art of the possible"" with GenAI. This integration framework can be enabled without necessarily building new capabilities, for instance, around data management, explainability, and content filtering in LLMs or in the agent-based model layer. Opportunities to leverage LLMs for industry-specific applications are extensive and continue to unfold, ranging from content analysis to creation and generation to summarization, automation, and translation. An infographic depicting five different types of opportunities to leverage LLMs for industry-specific applications, including: analyzing, creating/generating, summarizing, automating, and translating. What can we do with large language models? The opportunities that await adopters of GenAI  technology extend to virtually all industries. The true value of leveraging generative LLMs within the enterprise lies in augmenting the abilities of people to work smarter and faster. Especially in functions where there is a significant amount of knowledge dependency, LLMs can improve overall work efficiency and human productivity. Knowledge dependency in a business function generally manifests as either a large number of people doing repetitive tasks or an overreliance on a few subject matter experts for critical thinking and decision-making. Enterprises have the opportunity to redefine how work gets done in this new GenAI era, automating time-consuming knowledge processing tasks and elevating the roles of their people to focus on tasks that require human cognition. Here are just a few examples of how LLMs may be used to augment the roles of humans today to drive increased value: Logistics: LLMs can be given a set of criteria and then create or generate well-written, plagiarism-free content as a result. This generative capability may include codes, reports, recommendations, questions and answers, commentary, and design documents. Banking: LLMs can automate many generative tasks, such as reports or dashboards. An investment research firm may use an LLM to create an automated portfolio optimization capability to improve returns. Manufacturing: The amount of content abstraction and contextualization provided by LLMs to summarize tasks can be leveraged for various utilities across domains and industries. An automotive manufacturer may use an LLM to summarize engineering notes for its assembly line workers or market research reports for product improvements. Capital markets: LLMs can analyze environmental parameters quickly and recommend the next-best course of action to take. Capital market firms might use an LLM to create an investment advisory bot for wealth management. Health: LLMs can translate text, generating human-like output in response to user input. A medical devices company might use an LLM to produce high-quality translations of spoken or written text on adverse drug events. Powered by LLMs, GenAI is a harbinger of change to drive enterprise value realization through the creation of autonomous AI capabilities. Some fine-tuning to make LLMs relevant within an enterprise context helps optimize their use. At the same time, guardrails must be put in place to mitigate the concerns of information security, regulatory compliance, and bias for consistent outcomes. By leveraging a framework that combines LLMs with an agent-based layer, organizations can safely pave a path to realizing new value through GenAI. This combined approach allows businesses to strike the desired balance between inventive capabilities and responsible usage of GenAI. Introducing an autonomous AI agent ecosystem within the enterprise can also free users from the technical burden of prompt design and engineering. Users can focus instead on defining their goals for driving outcomes, and then let autonomous agents do the work of achieving them. This paradigm shift enables a more intuitive and efficient user experience, extending GenAI access for enterprise employees to drive greater value realization. The next Picasso won't be human!

Infosys,Modernizing enterprises: The power of generative AI in code migration,"Copyright © 2022 Infosys Limited Modernizing enterprises: The power of generative AI in code migration Stay connected with our latest Insights Thank you for subscription. Apple Podcasts Google Podcasts Spotify SoundCloud Enterprises are in a race to modernize. Code migration is part of the answer, but traditional approaches are slow and require access to talent, which is in short supply. A generative AI approach offers numerous benefits, including faster migration and consistent code quality. Modern enterprises are complex, interconnected systems. Over 88% of these systems are legacy, according to Infosys Knowledge Institute research in 2022, and there are more than 220 billion lines of Cobol code still used in production around the world. Maintaining this diverse tech stack is resource-intensive and difficult to govern, requiring specialized teams with expertise in different technologies. Modernization, which relies on code migration — the process of moving software code among environments, platforms, or languages — has become essential to simplify this spaghetti of different systems and codebases, supporting faster, more efficient business operations. However, most businesses still rely on traditional approaches to code migration, including: Relying on manual or tool-based code migration is a problem, especially since the number of developers with skills in older languages such as Cobol is dwindling: “Finding the Cobol engineers — how many people know that?”, says Amin Venjara, chief data officer of 75-year-old payroll-processing company ADP. Modernization also requires experts proficient in both source and target technologies. This is challenging. In our Modernization Radar, 51% of respondents cited a lack of skills and talent as a bigger pain point than the risks of disruption and cost. This talent shortage is compounded by the fact that some legacy systems, in use for many years, present unique challenges due to obsolete architectures and outdated documentation. Business performance can also be at risk during the transition from older to new technologies, despite parallel development efforts. Modernization also risks loss of functionality and data. Perhaps the steepest hill to climb when bringing executives on board a legacy migration project is that modernization is expensive.  Return on investment (ROI) is also hard to measure, and technical teams often don’t speak the language of the business, instead talking about technical issues without outlining the benefits of modernization, including efficiency and architectural compatibility with important technologies like AI, and APIs. The truth is that businesses investing in the right modernization approach can expect over 200% ROI over three years. One way to tackle these challenges is with generative AI. Large language models (LLMs) can automate and optimize the code migration process, maintain operational efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure software compatibility. “As we get better and better at using generative AI for code migration, we’re going to see some really nice gains for people that have either stalled or been putting off a lot of their digital transformation work,” Fiona Tan, CTO of Boston-based Wayfair, an American e-commerce company, recently told the Wall Street Journal. As of 2024, 63% of businesses are trialling generative AI for tasks like code generation and maintenance. Compared with existing tools, generative AI can parse the code and can accelerate the conversion of frameworks and languages such as Cobol into Java. By understanding syntax and structure and leveraging datasets of programming languages (to deal with legacy code, LLMs have to be trained on the specific codebase), these models eliminate human error and accelerate modernization without altering core architecture. This process also optimizes the code for enhanced performance on the new platform or technology. At one North American airline, the codebase didn’t allow it to add modern functionalities to its tech stack, and dependency on this codebase was considerable. To get the benefits of modern technology as well as maintain greater control, the airline conducted a proof of concept for migrating to Java on a hyperscaler platform. The process included using generative AI for tech stack analysis and migration requirements. Multiple models and prompts were evaluated to check the quality of the code conversions, and only the best translation was integrated into the target tech stack. In another implementation, a Dutch energy company was running on a codebase that limited its flexibility to integrate further technology for competitive advantage. The approach taken here used generative AI to set the framework for the migration and followed that with the actual code migration exercise. LLM-enabled bots were used to generate documentation from Cobol and Job Control Language (JCL) programs, and generative AI was further used to rework the documents into requirements and to understand the application architecture, which is an essential starting point for dealing with legacy code. Generative AI-infused testing applications also generated test cases from the document requirements. Once the code was translated, the code was deployed manually against the test cases so that the new code met the functional requirements extracted from the Cobol. But care should be taken when using generative AI at scale. The following eight recommendations hold for large enterprises starting out on their own projects: By following the approach above, businesses can reduce their reliance on aging codebases and a workforce that can’t understand how they work. Generative AI becomes a way to reduce the cost of migration and offers a more efficient approach to optimize migration workflows, enhance precision, and adapt to changing patterns. Those that get to the other side will find themselves better positioned to innovate, scale, and remain competitive in an ever-evolving market.

Infosys,Digital Channels | Infosys,"UX has become more 3D, social, experiential, embodied, and persistent. Advanced untethered or standalone devices drive immersive digital experiences with robust real-time 3D applications. Devices like Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest Pro, and HoloLens are set to boost developments in spatial computing. In such scenarios, environmental scanning/mapping is done to get a detailed representation of real-world surfaces to create true/ seamless hybrid experiences. Digital twins can also be used in industries as disparate as healthcare, energy, financial services and manufacturing - creating dynamic, virtual representations of complex systems using both operational technology (OT) and informational technology (IT). The twin reduces operating cost, extends equipment life in manufacturing and energy, and troubleshoots known vulnerabilities in real time, leading to greater value capture. AI and GenAI drive adoption by auto generating content, including images, virtual worlds, and lifelike avatars. Enterprises can harness this evolution for employee engagement, hybrid workplace, collaborative work, training, digital twins, self-help, and remote field force assistance, boosting productivity and efficiency. Infosys has developed a Meta Quests 2 experience for a large American bank to attract a younger, web-savvy audience. This immersive solution fosters innovative customer acquisition, product marketing, and brand promotion within the virtual world. 2D/3D avatars are virtual representations that immerse users in a shared virtual world, fostering engaging collaboration. They create a safe environment for confident virtual communication. Advancements in lip sync, animations (walking, hands, eyes movements), and facial expressions make avatars more lifelike. GenAI enhances text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and language translation, enriching the overall experience. Infosys has developed a private metaverse for a large American consulting firm to shape the future of work. Audit managers select predefined avatars and customize attires, accessories, and more. These avatars engage in training, meetings, onboarding, and other activities. At the AWS re:Invent 2022, an annual developers conference, Infosys introduced a personalized avatar showcase.

Infosys,Green Energy: Geothermal Energy with Ai-First Sustainable Development,"This whitepaper explores a new method of extraction of heat from granite from any depth using a U-tube design has been proposed here that is designed especially for bore-wells tapping thermal energy from volcanic islands and can be positioned over off-shore platforms augmented by AI and GenAI Vision models. Population growth, agricultural expansion, the industrial revolution, and urban development have placed significant stress on water resources. The current regional climate conditions are exacerbating this stress on water and the agricultural sector. In the last decade, green water sources have diminished dramatically, posing a threat of food scarcity to countries. This is particularly evident in GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) and MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries. Only 11–13% of the total annual precipitation on continents is available as fresh water, and the entire global population utilizes 2% of this precipitation. Of this small fraction, merely 0.77% supports domestic and agricultural sectors. This amount will be insufficient in the next two decades, as the demand for fresh water is projected to exceed 5000 km³/year (5000 x 10¹² L/year), up from the current demand of 4000 km³/year. Consequently, the world is heading towards severe water scarcity. For a global population of 8 billion, with a daily requirement of 1000 liters per person, the current demand for freshwater amounts to approximately 8 trillion liters per day (2930 cubic kilometers per year). To address this challenge, nations have embraced the concept of virtual water trade, allowing agricultural products to move from one country to another, thereby distributing water resources on a global scale. Countries have recognized that certain practices are unsustainable, a fact that became indisputable during the COVID-19 period. To ensure water and food security, the desalination of seawater is being employed.  From virtual water network the world should move towards water independent countries. The world is adopting desalination to secure water supplies. However, desalination of seawater is an energy-intensive process. Currently, millions of liters of oil are used for desalination. To produce 1 m³ of water, 2 to 7 kWh of electricity is required, which is not a sustainable solution. The exploration of geothermal resources requires managing numerous uncertainties, presenting challenges for investment and operational decisions. Data centers and semiconductor plants, with their high energy demands, necessitate a reliable power source. Geothermal energy has the potential to supplant fossil fuels, thereby transforming the global energy landscape into a more sustainable one. To meet the demands of innovation, there is a push to develop AI solutions that optimize geothermal power generation. This includes identifying the most productive underground locations for maximum clean energy output. An energy source that is carbon footprint-free and can rival the efficiency of fossil fuels is the heat from the Earth. Geothermal energy is the sole solution that can provide a sustainable water-food system for the world. This energy is free and accessible from any location on Earth. By developing AI algorithms/models that interpret surface patterns to predict geothermal potential, and utilizing geological modeling to pinpoint optimal well locations, we can ensure access to the hottest zones and maximize power generation potential. Prediction of values over time (or multi time variant) time series or regression problem. The goal is to create and deploy the technology and systems needed to simultaneously reduce emissions while meeting the world’s growing energy demands, ensuring progress for people and the planet, on the journey to net zero and beyond. Figure 2. Energy Beneath our feet Energy continuously flows from the Earth to the surface via conduction. The heat flux from the Earth creates a temperature gradient of approximately 35°C per kilometer. Moreover, the Earth's crust contains a large  amount of radioactive elements that contribute to this heat flux. It is now possible to commercially harness this free energy through a technology known as Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). The magnitude of energy produced by EGS cannot be matched by current renewable sources such as solar and wind. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) are a technology used to harness the Earth's internal heat for generating electricity and other direct applications. A borehole is drilled into granite, a common type of rock in the Earth's crust, to depths of 3 to 4 km where temperatures range from 350-400°C. Heat exchanger tubes are then inserted into the borehole to extract the heat using water or liquid carbon dioxide, as illustrated in Figure 3. In the context of climate change and global warming, the strategies adopted to mitigate related disasters have not yielded satisfactory results with commonly adopted renewable energies. These methods have not demonstrated significant advantages or reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Contrarily, sources like solar PV, wind, and biomass, often touted as green energy solutions, are causing more environmental damage than fossil fuels. These sources ultimately rely on fossil fuels for their development, contradicting the primary objective of reducing GHG emissions and achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Approximately 15,000 island nations depend on imported energy, food, and other commodities. These islands possess an immense amount of heat beneath them and represent untapped EGS fields. Harnessing the abundant geothermal energy at no cost and with a zero-carbon footprint could fulfill several SDGs for island nations and the world at large. Figure 3 presents a schematic diagram of a stand-alone offshore platform harnessing supercritical temperatures beneath islands to operate a geothermal power unit that generates electricity. Water or liquid CO2 is circulated through the blue tube, where it is heated, evaporated, and then rises to the surface at a temperature of 200°C. This heated liquid then flows through a heat exchanger containing a low boiling point organic fluid. Figure 3. Enhanced Geothermal Systems The fluid evaporates, creating high pressure that drives a turbine connected to a generator, thereby producing electricity. This process operates continuously, 24/7, regardless of external weather conditions. The system boasts an efficiency greater than 90%. It emits no carbon dioxide, and the electricity produced is environmentally friendly. This supercritical Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) is capable of generating 40 MWe. Multiple platforms can be installed offshore, depending on energy demand. Each megawatt-electric (MWe) produced by this supercritical heat source can supply 7,884 megawatt-hours (MWh), or about 8 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity. This represents a significant amount of energy. This free energy can be harnessed for electricity generation, desalination to produce fresh water, support for domestic and agricultural sectors, and to produce green hydrogen and ammonia. The list underscores the economic significance of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) for island nations. Without relying on fossil fuels, these countries can achieve independence in water, food, and energy, and can pursue a growth-oriented, sustainable economy. Hydrogen produced through the electrolysis of water is considered true ""Green Hydrogen."" Since electrolysis is an energy-intensive process, using fossil fuels for this purpose is not cost-effective. However, with the availability of free energy, island nations have the potential to become global centers to produce green hydrogen. As an added value, this hydrogen can be used to produce green ammonia, paving the way for a global supply chain network for green hydrogen and ammonia. Shifting Focus: Tech Adoption: Exponential evolution in data, technology & AI drive value in Geothermal industry. Rising Tide: GenAI Vision models are very helpful in processing large volume of subsurface data to identify a potential site for drilling. The time taken to process the site selection data, using normal computational devises takes several months. Vision models can cut short this time and prepare the next stage of drilling for resource evaluation. There is a good amount of cost savings in this process. Quantum Leap: Sustainability goals taking huge setback due to global events and energy availability. The geothermal fluid flow rate, the temperatures at the injection and production wells, the temperature of the injection fluid, and the quantity of electricity generated (which can be increased or decreased based on demand) are critical parameters. As these units operate independently from remote locations, a regulatory mechanism is necessary for: AI can play a major role in the following project execution items: Narrow Transformer GenAI model contextualized for the geothermal specific knowledge and domain as opposed to general-purpose LLMs helps our Geothermal use cases. These models must be parameter efficient fine-tuned using custom datasets(Geological and geophysical data) on a relevant open-source pre-trained model fine-tuned for the geo-thermal scope. Narrow transformers offer a powerful and efficient way to leverage GenAI technology within streamlining workflows, monitoring, measuring, improving communication, and boosting crew productivity. Given the oil industry's expertise in drilling deep wells and constructing stand-alone platforms, they could be valuable partners in this venture. Thermo-hydro-mechanical models of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) have shown that the Levelized Cost of Power (LCOP) generated from islands using EGS technology could range from 6 to 7 US cents per kWh, without any hidden costs, unlike power produced from fossil fuels. Regarding the cost of desalinated water, a consistent supply of freshwater will be available to support domestic and agricultural needs, regardless of weather conditions, liberating the islanders from reliance on food imports. Currently, the cost of freshwater produced via desalination using fossil fuels stands at US$1 per cubic meter. This cost is projected to decrease by more than 50% when utilizing the free energy source provided by EGS. Blue Economy & Growth Opportunity Given that energy is free, devoid of hidden costs and environmental concerns, both the energy and IT sectors stand to gain significant financial benefits and opportunities for robust economic growth. Island nations could become centers for energy (green hydrogen), as well as food and water production. An AI First & AI controlled supply chain network could oversee the entire system, leading to uniform sustainable development and a world free from conflicts over water, food, & energy. Energy transmission and distribution system is not specific to geothermal power plants. T and D is an inherent component/issue to any power plant. What is known as load distribution during peak and non-peak periods. AI can monitor the T and D and take a decision in supplying  priorities. For example, if the power demand is low, AI can reduce power production from a power plant. Decommissioning a geothermal plant arises after 40 to 50 yea or more. For example, the Larderello geothermal power plant is 100 years old and is still generating power to its installed capacity. AI will indicate those power plants that are not effectively & efficiently working, decommissioning of such plants follow the protocol of oil rigs. We can leverage geothermal energy as an energy source to minimize Water & Food Crisis of planet earth. AI augmentation allows for the monitoring of key metrics, saves time and improves productivity, ensuring balanced power generation by addressing AI use cases such as: Prakash Karimaraka Industry Principal Dornadula Chandrasekharam Distinguish Professor, Izmir Institute of Technology, IYTE and Ex-IIT Mumbai Professor Trends that guide toward a Live Enterprise Copyright © 2024 Infosys Limited To keep yourself updated on the latest technology and industry trends subscribe to the Infosys

Infosys,GPT the Untamed Wild LLM: Fundamental Limitations and Solutions for Enterprise Implementation,"This whitepaper explores generative pretrained transformer (GPT) large language model (LLM) capabilities in context of its fundamental limitations leading to restricted enterprise applicability and how these can be addressed. A generative pretrained transformer LLM is a very powerful tool with a wide span of capabilities but restricted in practical applicability because of its fundamental limitations. It is intriguing to observe all the myriads of things a LLM can do in a human-like way generating novel contents including texts, images, audios, videos and more. But irrespective of how wide spanning the capabilities are, unless the intended business use case is served rightly, it is not fit for enterprise use. Essentially it can be termed a wild LLM, just like a wild horse, having lots of power but not fit for specific purposes unless tamed well. Before we delve deep into the wild nature of generative pretrained models (GPTs), let us get some understanding on the Language Models (LM) space which has now led to the GPTs of the world. The language model space has over 100 years of history, from early Markov Model research in 1906, to first NLP application ELIZA in 1966, and the pathbreaking Transformer model architecture in 2017 leading up to LLMs of the world today. It is interesting to note that there was a brief AI winter from mid-1970s owing primarily to technology limitations in storage & compute, funding shortage, and fragmented research. Language modeling space witnessed a paradigm shift from 2020 onwards starting with GPT-3, the GenAI democratizing ChatGPT in 2022, and release of increasingly more powerful LLMs in the following years. Currently there is renewed focus on the implementation aspects of LLMs including deployment frameworks, specialized agents, safety guardrails, domain-specific & narrow models, fine-tuning & RAG variants, and more. Figure 1. A timeline view of evolution of language models leading up to GPT LLMs of the world A generative transformer model, pretrained on humongous amounts of generic world data, is like a wild horse – very powerful but not tamed. It is fascinating to observe all the myriads of things it does in a human-like way generating novel contents from question responses, story text, images, to videos and more. This very true with the recent models like GPT-4, Calude-3, Gemini 1.5, Llama-3, and any other recent GPT LLM. Here one point to note is that, while industrially GPT is a brand name used by OpenAI for it models but in a broader academic context it can refer to all transformer-based models which are pre-trained and generative in nature. A typical characteristic of these high profile GPT LLMs is its generalization or the capability to address a wide range of tasks across myriad domains of expertise. This very capability, which gives it a human-like novel response character, is becoming the key reason which limits the direct practical application in enterprises. To put in a nutshell, while these models perform increasingly well in academia and generic tasks, these are not fit for purpose in practical enterprise business scenarios. When it comes to enterprise implementation, the requirement will always be specific and contextual to certain scope. Like responding to customer questions in virtual assistants, dynamic personalization for sales content, generating code or SQL queries, etc. – all of which requires a specific task focus and grounding to relevant factual information including the enterprise context. And these generic generative LLMs, when subject to such narrow task scenarios in enterprise business use cases, generally tends to generate near approximate content based on whatever pretraining it had – mostly resulting in generative defects which is more commonly termed as hallucination. This is especially so in cases like code generation which requires precision to the last character generated, or an end customer service chat assistant which can be legally responsible for anything it generates, and so on. Figure 2. The fundamental limitations of generic GPT LLMs in practical scenarios Let us take an example of SQL generation based on input text to understand this problem in detail. In a text-to-SQL task, beyond the input text understanding which is an area well handled by most generic LLMs, typically there are three main pivotal factors in generating the right SQL query, So, as we saw here in the example, two of the key factors required are not directly known to a generic generative pre-trained transformer LLM. Though steps and factors might vary, this is true with the case of any type of use case addressing specialized tasks and/or requiring enterprise contextual knowledge. In addition to this contextualization and hallucinations problem, the security risks and ethical concerns are another front of challenges generic LLM brings to the table. With the generative nature of applications involved, the risks are multifold and can be either inherent to the model or perpetrated by another party. This risk is further aggravated by the fact that internal working of a generic LLM is open to any external party as much it is to the implementing enterprise. Table 1: Detailed explanation of the fundamental challenges faced by generic GPT LLMs when coming to practical business/enterprise use case implementation In a way a generic GPT LLM can be compared to a wild animal, maybe a wild stallion, which is not tamed - very powerful and has high potential but not domesticated for a purpose. And irrespective of how powerful it is, unless the intended purpose is served rightly, it is not fit for use. Now that we have discussed in detail the fundamental limitations with GPT LLMs when it comes to business implementations, let us see how to address these challenges practically and effectively. And while we do not plan to go into fine-grained details of each solution option, let us try to paint a clear guideline of how to address them. Like any other use case, the first thing to do is understand the use case. While this looks routine and basic, with GenAI in the mix, implementation teams have started undermining the importance of this step – assuming that LLM model is a magic solution for almost any requirement. These large generic LLM models are of course very powerful but carries the fundamental limitations we discussed earlier which are detrimental for business use case application. Many implementations being tried out now are just relying on the brute force of LLMs, and essentially fails to achieve the objective in most cases and in cases the functional objective is achieved proves to be inefficient. This is where we need to understand the use case and address the limitations of the model effectively to implement an optimal solution. The solution is straightforward – tame and domesticate the wild GPT model for the exact purpose at hand. So, how do you do it? Let us again start with the analogy of a wild horse and see how to do it. Table 2: Pragmatic view of the solution approaches to address the limitations of generic GPT LLMs alongside a wild horse domestication analogy The below illustrative schematic (Figure 3) gives a sneak peek view of how the earlier mentioned challenges in implementation of GPT LLMs can be addressed. It depicts a simplified view of four different implementation approaches for LLM applications, and we will use these as examples to compare and understand the solution guidelines we discussed. While we will not get into the detailed design of these implementation options, it gives a good overview of how task alignment, right context, and proper pipeline engineering approach/framework can help with practical implementation of LLMs. Figure 3. Simplified implementation flow of prompting, finetuning, and RAG methods individually and combined. Solid arrows represent active flows, while the dotted ones represent prior completed steps. (Source: References #9) Quick understanding of what these design options are and how they compare Experiments based on these options have shown that as we move from designs on left to right, the accuracy and content of the responses have improved by considerable margins – from the far-left simple prompting getting the response incorrect almost every time, to fairly accurate response in individual finetuned and RAG based designs, and even better response in the right most compound chain design. Here the experiment task was SQL statement generation (text-to-SQL), which needs to be accurate both in terms of syntax and local database schema, by understanding the right intent and business context of the user input/question. Also, it is important to note that while we have not covered the security aspects in these designs, safety guardrails are a critical component for productionizing business use cases. Essentially it is all about aligning, contextualizing, engineering, and securing the GPT LLM for the exact task and use case at hand. Though this can be achieved with a monolithic model, a more practical approach will be a compound AI system where different specialized components come together to address the common purpose. And while there are standard frameworks like LangChain which enable many of the capabilities we discussed, there is no comprehensive package with all the dimensions covered especially when it comes to domain-specific needs. Most of the enterprises seeking to implement enterprise scale LLM applications are now focusing on bespoke solutions and frameworks either leveraging standard frameworks or with a greenfield approach. To put in a nutshell, a GPT LLMs are very powerful tools with a wide span of capabilities but restricted in practical applicability because of its fundamental limitations. It is intriguing to observe all the myriads of things it can do in a human-like way generating novel contents from question responses, story text, images, to videos and more. But irrespective of how wide spanning the capabilities are, unless the intended business use case is served rightly, it is not fit for enterprise use. Now to quickly look at these fundamental limitations And the solution guidelines to address the limits can be summarized as While GPT LLM capabilities are improving by leaps and bounds, the business/enterprise implementation side of things has not yet achieved the desired level of maturity. Approaches like parameter efficient finetuning techniques, retrieval augmented generation variants, domain-specific & narrow models, emerging high-efficiency model architectures, agentic frameworks, response guardrails, and other evolving implementation focused methodologies are steps in the right direction.

Infosys,How AI can drive transformation in telecoms | Infosys Knowledge Institute,"Copyright © 2022 Infosys Limited How AI can drive transformation in telecoms Stay connected with our latest Insights Thank you for subscription. Apple Podcasts Google Podcasts Spotify SoundCloud Integrating AI across telecom businesses will bring strategic and financial advantages in this competitive space. Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the telecom industry: From chip manufacturers and telecom equipment manufacturers to cloud providers and software companies, stakeholders across the telecom value chain are tapping into AI's opportunities. However, adoption remains in its early stages, with many companies still only experimenting with a limited set of established use cases, such as enhancing customer service or generating marketing content, rather than embracing a comprehensive AI-first strategy. Telecoms need to move on to the next stage of their AI journey by choosing the right use cases and strategically integrating AI across a range of activities (Figure 1) in their businesses. Source: Infosys Knowledge Institute The telecom retail industry, covering both digital and physical channels, generates significant revenue, making a strong user experience crucial for customer retention. So it is not surprising that a recent study highlights improved customer experience as a top industry trend for telecom companies. AI-driven customer service enhancements can help telecoms move away from conventional methods that often lead to poor customer service. The telecom retail industry, covering both digital and physical channels, generates significant revenue, making a strong user experience crucial for customer retention. While these capabilities significantly reduce wait times, ease the work of human agents, and minimize the hassle for customers, the key here is to train customer service executives to effectively query the AI platform for the best results. Gains from AI in automating tasks, delivering insights and recommendations, and improving personalization are not exclusive to telecoms. However, telecoms are particularly well-equipped to get the best out of AI, thanks to the extensive customer data they gather. Personalization and targeted campaigns: With AI and data analytics, telecom companies can refine personalization. Deploying AI to analyze customer data — including interactions, preferences, and past purchases — to identify patterns, segment more meaningfully, and uncover insights helps sales teams tailor their pitches and marketing teams plan targeted campaigns. Having AI monitor, analyze, and report social media feedback, competitor market, and customer interactions helps companies adjust product pricing, policies, and marketing efforts to better suit customer needs.

Infosys,Generative AI for supply chain management,"Copyright © 2022 Infosys Limited Generative AI for supply chain management Stay connected with our latest Insights Thank you for subscription. Apple Podcasts Google Podcasts Spotify SoundCloud Supply chain management has been a relative laggard in adopting generative AI. However, it is catching up, and there is significant potential in priority areas, while adopting lessons from other functions across industries and geographies. The recent Infosys Generative AI Radar study for North America revealed several insights for supply chain management. SCM is a board room topic, alongside chief information security officers and cyber security experts as senior decision makers. However, the champion for implementing generative AI in enterprise supply chains remains unclear. Supply chain ranks lowest in establishing business value through use cases. However, user experience and personalization emerge as the most positive use cases of generative AI among supply chain and logistics companies (Figure 1). This emphasizes generative AI’s near-term potential value from external-facing processes like customer service, in contrast to internal ones that focus on operations and efficiency. Source: Infosys Knowledge Institute The shift in priorities due to post-pandemic disruptions and events such as the Ukraine war significantly hindered generative AI use cases in supply chain management. Traditionally, supply chains focused on speed, cost, and quality metrics. These disruptions caused business leaders to prioritize resilience to recover from unforeseen shocks, sustainability for least carbon emission, localization to mitigate risks and diversify supplier base, and agility for timely and rational decision making (see Figure 2). Recent supply chain disruptions caused business leaders to prioritize resilience, sustainability, and localization. Source: ASCM’s SCOR model, Infosys Knowledge Institute We see the emergence of a digital supply chain, with information as the driver for decision making. AI and digital twins enable stress testing to identify weak areas which require investment and management attention. Sourcing critical parts such as semiconductor chips remains a weak link, as an example. A spike during the pandemic in high-end chips for consumer goods affected other industries that used low margin chips. Timely information flow among stakeholders preempts disruptions, enabling AI to convert data into actionable insights that drive decision making. Generative AI in supply chain management holds immense potential for resiliency and efficiency. Organizations must explore potential use cases that enhance efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, and drive non-linear growth. Projections suggest global generative AI supply chain investment to reach $13 billion (about $40 per person in the US) by 2032 at a CAGR of 46% from $301 million in 2022. For North America, the recent Infosys generative AI survey that involved over 1,000 respondents estimated the investment to double in the next 12 months to around $70 million. Organizations must explore generative AI use cases that enhance efficiency, amplify customer satisfaction, and drive non-linear growth. Generative AI offers myriad applications to improve supply chain operations. Readily deployable use cases include automating customer services, synthesizing and automating document creation (contracts, logistics and custom papers), demand forecasting, and predictive maintenance. Beyond new content creation, generative AI understands patterns from existing content and competitive insights, according to a recent article in Harvard Business Review. Despite the enthusiasm around generative AI’s potential advantages, supply chains present multiple challenges, including data security, privacy, and access to publicly available AI tools within corporate IT landscapes. These concerns prompt firms to develop generative AI solutions in-house or with vendors, potentially missing proven off-the-shelf toolkits offered by open models. For skill development, organizations tend to partner with vendors to tap into their talent pool; for internal talent development, they upskill existing employees familiar with industry rules and regulations. So far, external talent recruitment has been a lower priority. The industry is tentatively ready to adapt and implement generative AI but may gather momentum with sufficient leadership direction and support. Gartner recently stated that 80% of the global supply chain is not incorporated into current digital decision models. The digital-to-reality gap will continue to hamper supply chain performance objectives until technology investments are complemented with decision support, says Gartner. The Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM) identifies AI and ML (Machine Learning) among the top 10 trends in supply chain management. However, it attributes the delay in generative AI adoption to the intricacies of supply chains and the necessity for company-specific model training. Simple, adoptable use cases for productivity include document drafting (emails, manuals, contracts), predictive analysis for risk management and mitigation, and automated customized content generation for marketing campaigns. Also, conversational AI is well-placed to manage customer service and query resolutions. Conversational AI is an evolved form of chatbots, combining natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), and machine learning to enable dynamic conversations. As LLMs advance, conversational AI becomes highly sought after across sectors for its capacity to provide real-time interactive use cases that enhance user experience. Supply chain management is a regulated industry with country-specific legal frameworks. It can benefit with LLMs built using existing knowledge and kept up to date. These LLMs answer queries, classify new documents, and create new documents such as contracts using prompt engineering. Siemens implemented an NLP tool in partnership with Infosys to classify tax documents, keeping Siemens tax consultants updated on taxation changes, classifying data, and summarizing tax-related conversations. This LLM (Large Language Model) model, built using GPT-3 and Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, facilitates tax-related knowledge classification and automated newsletter generation. While supply chains address issues like data security and the complexities of integrating digital technologies, it presents extraordinary opportunity for significant growth and improved efficiency. “Introducing AI into supply chains is not just an improvement of current processes, it represents a complete overhaul of how decisions are made, and operations are conducted.” says Dr Mukesh Kumar, associate professor, Institute for Manufacturing, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge. The challenge is to move through this rapidly evolving landscape by strategically developing skills, adopting modern technologies, and striking a balance between custom-built solutions and open AI tools. Generative AI provides insights by analyzing trends and predicting disruptions, optimizes logistics and inventory through predictive analytics, and automates operational tasks to improve efficiency. While generative AI may enhance agility and competitiveness, its use in supply chain strategic decision making remains unexplored. However, efforts are underway to advance AI utilization in this arena. The following use cases represent generative AI applications in supply chain management, subject to data to build models that accurately represent current ways of working. Supply chains are the delivery network of today’s global economy. They move physical goods and data simultaneously, worldwide. Unfortunately, this also elevates cybersecurity and data privacy as top concerns for generative AI adoption. Governance mechanisms and security systems design are persistent priorities to adopt generative AI for supply chain management. “Generative AI has significant potential for value in the decision-focused areas of supply chain,” says Robert Winans, vice president, head of supply chain, Panasonic Energy North America. It’s inevitable that generative AI will greatly enhance areas like raw materials planning, sourcing, procurement, and logistics. We recommend four practices for business leaders to accelerate their generative AI journey, in stages of increasing complexity: To stay competitive, firms should investigate advanced implementations at each supply chain stage. Supply chain management faces significant volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. Timely data flow and AI developing valuable insights offers firms the tools needed to address these challenges.

Dan is a director in charge of digital twin and data analytics, and Kristina is a director for user experience. Welcome to you all. Dan Wagner: Thank you. Kristina Sutton: Thanks. Chad Watt: Erian, tell us a little bit about your background and your current role at AT&T. Erian Laperi: Well, Chad, first of all, I want to say thank you for the opportunity to have us here and tell our story and our journey. My team is currently responsible for leading and developing next-generation AI and GenAI automation solutions and tools that help modernize and simplify processes and systems for our network teams. Our work is deeply rooted in design principles that put users and customers first. My team also leads the expansion of AT&T's digital twin capabilities that enable new business value creation by making analytics operational and operations more analytical. My journey with AT&T started right out of college. It's an amazing technology company to work for that is obsessed with customer service and delighting customers. As you said, AT&T is a big company, but at heart, it has the spirit of an entrepreneurial and innovative small company, where one can have many careers, building on top of experiences and people networks. Chad Watt: AT&T has a massive complex network. How have you simplified the operational and business support systems for that network? Erian Laperi: Well, we've taken a holistic approach, Chad, to identifying areas of the business that we can simplify. When we kicked off the journey a few years ago, I saw a need to do things differently, so that this wasn't just another initiatives that lost steam after a couple of years. I'm a big believer in design thinking, and we championed creating, putting together our own design thinking team within the network organization, a vision that our leadership fully supported. By standing up this team to be focused solely on designing the experience that we want, we were able to approach this transformation differently than our other transformations in the past. Today, we've provided recommendations and implemented many process and system changes that ultimately can eliminate significant number of legacy applications, removing duplications of tools and swiveled sharing, while driving cost out of the business. But most importantly, improving the experience of our employees and of our customers. Chad Watt: Kristina, tell us how you use design thinking in this process. Kristina Sutton: So since starting this journey, we've created, really, a whole ecosystem of practices and tools that we leverage to really start with the end user and learn about what they do and how they approach the problems that they need to solve. So we've designed a process and a practice that's both flexible enough to adapt to new information as we uncover it, but it's rigid enough that we can deliver these results very quickly. So starting with the end user, we leverage design thinking to take a user-centric approach, so we really go into the field. We start with that end user, the technicians that are going to use our systems and tools that we're wanting to create. We start with constructing, actually, personas to identify the various work functions that these folks using the tool are going to do on a daily basis. From there, we job shadow. We conduct more interviews, leveraging all of our interview kits, and we observe people in the same role. Sometimes for our smaller projects, just a few, but for our large-scale projects, we will chat with dozens of technicians before we can get to a point where we understand that function inside and out. Chad Watt: That sounds like terrific front-end work and really kind of engaging, enjoyable work there. Tell us a little bit more about what value that delivers. Kristina Sutton: So really, by starting with the end user and by championing the things that they need in a system or tool, we're really able to build a lot of trust, both with the development teams that we work with on a daily basis and the business SMEs that we partner with to help us transform the business. So in 2024 alone, we delivered a technology roadmap that included a new application for all technicians, a new routing engine for all of our technicians, and a new workflow management system, again, for all of our technicians. In 2023, our NST program simplified how we build our network, consolidating more than 50 systems and tools into a unified workflow engine, which improved our construction cycle time and the overall quality of the build. Chad Watt: Let me ask you to double-click on that. You deliver these new applications, these new products, these new tools. What's some new factor or new element to those things? Kristina Sutton: Sure, so we actually have taken, with one of our products, multiple systems that our technicians currently have to use today, and we've put all of the information into one seamless front-end experience. So our technicians now can actually take a ticket, work their ticket, close the ticket, and move on to the next job, all in one system. But what's most exciting about that is really how we're going to build on that in 2025 and 2026, by incorporating next-best action and recommendations for how to even do their jobs better. Chad Watt: We're talking about AI in action. It's great. Erian Laperi: And Chad, it's not just about making an upgrade into new technologies or consolidating from many tools to one tools. It's about making the experience simpler and better. In the example that Kristina mentioned, in one of the use cases, we went from 60-plus milestones to complete certain projects down to 20-plus milestones, allowing the AI and automation to handle manual tasks that otherwise our employees and engineers would have to handle manually. Chad Watt: So Dan, you have a massive real-world network, and you've established a digital twin of that network. Give us your definition of digital twin and describe to me how AT&T makes use of that. Dan Wagner: Yeah, our definition of a digital twin,, really is a semantic layer that represents the data, the logic, actions, and decisions that define our network and our business. It means it not only represents the physical elements of what we do but also the operational actions and the human elements that make everything possible. It's not just towers and circuits, but it's work orders and tickets and invoices and machine learning models, even more than that. Everything that enables AT&T to operate on a daily basis. It's an extremely important and effective tool, and using the digital twin as the foundation for analytical operations, we enable workflows and things like ticket and alarm correlation, decommissioning of wireline equipment, cost reduction, circuit consolidation, and machine learning models that help us avoid dispatches. Chad Watt: Your real-world network is dynamic and constantly evolving. How do you keep the digital twin up to date? Dan Wagner: The digital twin itself is connected to the core systems in the network. It's all done via the ontology that we talked about. Really, that representation of the digital twin allowing us to easily add, change, adapt things as they rapidly develop. Things are changing all the time. Chad Watt: Dan, you've applied design thinking. You've built a digital twin, and now you're using generative AI to make a network more efficient and resilient. What have you learned about making generative AI useful in this work? Dan Wagner: Yeah, really, to make GenAI truly useful and to make it truly work, the enterprise must be able to incorporate it in operational workflows. Without an ontology that represents the digital twin of the network, we wouldn't have been able to do this so rapidly. The ontology, really, is a language of generative AI. It allows us to use LLMs to quickly deploy workflows without developing domain-specific models for telco. That's the really important mark. Chad Watt: Let's talk about information and wisdom, Erian. Machine learning, neural networks, and generative AI are effective at rewriting information. How do you use them to deliver valuable knowledge that empowers workers and benefits AT&T? Erian Laperi: Yeah, so we do this through giving the employees the tools to use these technologies safely and effectively. Through Ask AT&T, which is our corporate GenAI platform, we ensure the safety and reliability of these cutting-edge technologies, along with the capabilities and tools for employees to do their jobs more effectively. Chad Watt: Now, the specific example I've heard about is how you evaluate network transport lines that perhaps on the surface seem underused. How do you factor resilience and redundancy alongside efficiency when you're evaluating your network? Erian Laperi: In this case, the GenAI evaluates the possibilities and the scenarios and makes recommendations that then are coded into the operational workflows that Dan mentioned earlier. An engineer still reviews the suggestions to ensure that we're making the right choices for AT&T and for our customers. Chad Watt: Gotcha. You've got that human in the loop. Erian Laperi: Absolutely. Chad Watt: What is next for generative AI at AT&T? Erian Laperi: Well, we expect these tools to continue to proliferate even farther, allowing AT&T to continuously improve the customer and employee experiences while also optimizing operational costs, so we can continue to invest in mobility networks and fiber. AI-driven transformation is changing work. It's changing work artifacts and workflows across every role, function, and business process, and we are positioned to unlock value from these technologies better than anyone. Chad Watt: What does it take to get professionals comfortable with generative AI and then using it an effective way? Dan Wagner: Sure, the only thing that is constant in our business or in any business is change. We think of GenAI agents as an unlimited number of the best interns possible to help people with their roles. We don't replace what they do today, but they unlock new opportunities for everyone, enabling our engineers, our planners, designers, technicians, you name it, to do what they do every day, but even better. Chad Watt: Erian, I understand you are sharing a lot of your AI-related work to telecom organizations responsible for setting industry standards. Why is that important for you to do? Erian Laperi: Well, to reach scale and ensure that these technologies and capabilities are designed with the right security and privacy protections from the start, it is important that we collaborate together with others in the marketplace. It is the right thing to do, and it benefits our customers the most. AT&T provides essential services to our customers, and we want these services to work flawlessly across the network and across the nation. Chad Watt: What is unique about AI and generative AI applied in telecom? Erian Laperi: We have a duty and responsibility to our customers that is of utmost importance. Making sure that these systems are safe and secure is critical. We work with our partners in compliance, security, legal, and privacy to ensure that AT&T is doing what is right for our customers and employees. Chad Watt: Great. What have you learned about AI that can be applied to other industries? Erian Laperi: Well, regardless of industry chat, being able to use AI and generative AI in actual operational workflows is what's going to make all the difference. Chat bots are great, but we have to be able to convert the insights into actions. Those technologies and tools that enable that will go much farther today than just standard question-answering. Chad Watt: Thank you for your time today, everyone. Is there anything else you'd like to add? Erian Laperi: We want to thank you for the time and the opportunity, and as I mentioned at the beginning, AT&T is a large company but also has the heart and the spirit of an entrepreneurial small-company focus on innovation and delighting customers. So I would really recommend to all of your listeners today, if they want to do an impact and do great things, come and explore doing those great things with AT&T.

Infosys,"European Firms Struggle to Generate Value from Generative AI, Yet Will Double Spending in 2024: Infosys Research","Being Resilient. That's Live Enterprise. Digital Core Capabilities Digital Operating Model Empowering Talent Transformations Tales of Transformation Industries Services Platforms Infosys Knowledge Institute About Us Ethics, Bias and Regulatory concerns slowing European adoption London, UK – December 5, 2023 Europe is doubling down on generative AI (GenAI) investment but is on a more cautious path than North America, according to new research from the Infosys Knowledge Institute (IKI), the research arm of Infosys (NSE, BSE, NYSE: INFY). The research forecasts that European companies will increase GenAI investments by 115% in the next year, to $2.8 billion. The pace of investment is slower than in North America where spend is expected to reach close to $6 billion. This more cautious spend is largely due to concerns around ethics and bias driven by the more regulated European market. However, European companies remain optimistic about generative AI’s impact on their business and are much more confident in their ability to train and recruit talent, as well as manage and control generative AI systems. For the Generative AI Radar 2023 – Europe report, IKI surveyed 1,000 respondents from companies across 11 Western European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and United Kingdom). The research, which is also supported by interviews with business leaders and AI practitioners, highlights the following insights. Balakrishna D. R. (Bali), Executive Vice President, Global Head of AI and Industry Verticals, Infosys, said “Generative AI is driving phenomenal transformation across industries, and investment is happening at a rapid pace. Against the backdrop of an ever-evolving regulatory landscape, organizations must embed responsible AI techniques to not only improve data quality and management, but effectively manage ethics and bias risks. Our research has shown that for European businesses to derive business value, they must develop and evolve an AI-first operating model that prioritizes business transformation and skills development, and enables them to maximize human potential.” To read the full report, please visit here.

Infosys,Data Protection and Privacy - Overview | Infosys,"Being Resilient. That's Live Enterprise. Digital Core Capabilities Digital Operating Model Empowering Talent Transformations Tales of Transformation Industries Services Platforms Infosys Knowledge Institute About Us The digital revolution fuelled by Generative AI (GenAI) and co-pilot tools is transforming businesses. AI has helped rapidly transform the way organizations operate, delivering a wave of benefits that empower workforces and drive success. From streamlining processes to unlocking hidden insights, AI injects intelligence into business processes. Businesses can cater to a more personalized customer journey, targeted recommendations and 24/7 assistance to help foster customer satisfaction, loyalty, and a stronger brand reputation. While these advancements empower human capital and drive innovation, with all the noise about the positives, there's a flip side. The models themselves can inadvertently leak sensitive information through their outputs. Even if that data wasn't directly part of their training, accidental exposure is a huge concern for organizations! Employees using GenAI tools might unknowingly include confidential details in prompts or uploads. While AI is extensively reliant on data, these datasets can be unclean and filled with biases, due to which the model could incorporate false negatives, in the results . Malicious actors can also exploit GenAI through adversarial attacks, manipulating training data or prompts to steal sensitive information or generate harmful content. These are just a few examples, highlighting the need for continuous adaptation in the face of evolving security threats. This rapid transformation necessitates a proactive approach from enterprises. They must embrace GenAI while establishing robust and adaptable security measures to build effective guardrails. As enterprises are expanding their footprint internationally, secure cross-border data transfers become a critical concern. Negotiating secure cross-border data transfers isn't just about scaling a single peak; it's traversing a complex mountain range of global and local regulations. Infosys helps in secure cross-border data transfer, which requires navigating data privacy regulations, implementing strong technical safeguards like encryption and access controls, and potentially using data anonymization. This ensures data remains protected while complying with global regulations like GDPR and CCPA, and the specific requirements of the target markets. This combined approach empowers businesses to securely navigate the complexities of international data transfers and leverage the opportunities of a globalized market. Furthermore, data privacy regulations are constantly evolving. Infosys stays ahead of the curve, continuously monitoring these changes to ensure your compliance strategy remains adaptable. This proactive approach safeguards the businesses from legal litigations and reputational risks, allowing them to operate with confidence in the ever-changing global landscape. In today's digital world, data protection and privacy are paramount. At Infosys, we understand this. Our team of data security and privacy experts are your navigators through the ever-changing data security landscape. We offer a comprehensive suite of cutting-edge privacy automation tools and customizable templates, ensuring holistic enterprise data protection. With Infosys, our clients achieve digital trust and unlock horizons of excellence in their business.

Infosys,Infosys Alert Solutions — Dispute Prediction,"Being Resilient. That's Live Enterprise. Digital Core Capabilities Digital Operating Model Empowering Talent Transformations Tales of Transformation Industries Services Platforms Infosys Knowledge Institute About Us Infosys Alert Solutions — Dispute Prediction As the volume of banking transactions grows exponentially, disputes in this area are also growing at a comparative rate. Disputes in the US market in 2023 are expected to be in the range of tens of millions. Handling disputes is complicated and expensive. The Infosys Alert Solutions uses a set of cutting-edge approaches to provide early warnings on disputes. The Infosys Alert Solutions has a powerful machine learning-based predictive and correlation engine which analyses the past data of customers and builds context-specific prediction models to identify the customers most likely to raise disputes. Furthermore, the Infosys Alert Solutions brings in state-of-the-art GenAI capabilities to understand customer sentiment, summarize and provide deeper insights on the core issues of the dispute. One of the foundational elements of this offering is the predictive and correlation engine with a set of curated machine learning algorithms. These algorithms are trained on the past customer data records using statistical and data mining approaches to create specific models which can identify the factors most suitable to predict disputes. The identified factors or parameters are then applied to the current set of transactions data to forecast the probability of future disputes. Based on the past learning, the model is able to predict the list of customers most likely to dispute. The UI displays the list of these customers along with all required elements for deeper analysis, for e.g., documents, system records, agent records amongst others. The solution has been enhanced with GenAI features to present a summarized view of the problem faced by the customer and further provide additional insights. This explainability feature can aid the users to understand the key drivers behind the model's predictions and initiate appropriate remedial actions. Infosys Alert Solutions can integrate with the bank’s standard operating procedures and systems to track the issues to closure, thus creating an effective remedial framework. The offering leverages Infosys’ experience of several decades in different banking process domains along with strong implementation credentials. This is coupled with Infosys’ expertise in AI/ML built over the past two decades and is built on the foundation of Infosys Topaz. Automated early warning of disputes to the bank along with aggregation of all key data / information elements and summarized view with insights can help in quick and appropriate remedial measures. The solution uses different AI techniques such as DocAI, NLP etc. in addition to GenAI to ingest and transform data from multiple data sources including documents, structured and unstructured data. The Infosys Alert Solutions bring an automated approach to preventing and managing disputes, integrating with the banks’ SOP and seamlessly fitting into the bank’s existing dispute management framework, thus reducing human dependency.

Infosys,Managed Security Services and Threat Detection and Response,"GenAI is an industry buzzword widely applied for its cognitive capabilities. It employs dataset crawling for model training and responding to human queries, predominantly used by security analysts for investigation and analysis. GenAI models carry risks such as data poisoning, extraction attacks, and erroneous incident analysis decisions. Organizations must consider these risks during model training. The technology empowers security operations with an automation-first, intelligence-driven, risk-based, threat-centric approach, ensuring swift incident response, threat containment, and insights into threat actors and their tactics. It also enhances information asset security preparedness. A European postal operator wanted to improve its cybersecurity investigations. Infosys assisted by leveraging LLMs to provide context, attribution, and MITRE Att&ck mapping for security alerts. Resultantly, analysts conduct advanced analysis and threat hunting to uncover unknown threats and enhance cybersecurity effectiveness. Capturing all essential events during a major cyber incident is crucial for analysts to correlate and assess its impact accurately. In such situations, the volume of generated events may become unpredictable and significantly increase. Frequently, critical events may be missed during ingestion into the SIEM platform due to volume or EPS-based subscription limitations. To overcome such situations, data pipeline solutions collect, process, and route data (event logs) by filtering out unnecessary data or by aggregating data into more manageable chunks. It prevents the ingestion of duplicate and nonessential events into the SIEM platform. A US food processing company, in collaboration with Infosys, onboarded a data pipeline solution to optimize data ingestion into its SIEM platform, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and cost effectiveness. This reduced the firm's EPS subscription by 30%, without missing any critical correlation event.

HCLTech,Generative AI amplifies the need for Financial Services to accelerate cloud adoption | HCLTech,"Search Search Close Search Search Close Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly emerging as a solution to address many of the customer experience and efficiency challenges facing the financial services industry (FSI). Although the technology has only recently emerged, it is expected to evolve rapidly with improved algorithms, enhanced explainability, wider data access, computing power enhancements and much more. Examples of the pivotal role GenAI will play in FSI include: Of course, these examples represent just a fraction of the possibilities offered by GenAI, as the industry is still figuring out how to leverage the technology to reach its full potential. Barriers challenging GenAI adoption in FSI While GenAI offers exciting possibilities, implementing it across the sector will require organizations to overcome many barriers. A few of the most prominent challenges include: Additional barriers include talent availability, cultural nuances and organizational dynamics, to name a few. However, businesses across FSI must focus on eliminating — or at least minimizing — the industry’s longstanding resistance to sweeping technology changes. Its gradual approach to cloud adoption, for example, has left organizations throughout the sector scrambling to catch up to their more technology-progressive competitors. The most successful businesses won’t make that same mistake with GenAI. And speaking of cloud, let’s explore why and how cloud is an effective answer for accelerating GenAI implementations. Effective cloud strategy and adoption accelerates GenAI implementation If implemented effectively, cloud can help financial services organizations drive their digital transformation priorities, improving customer experience, offering competitive products and services and being more efficient. GenAI implementations are far more effective with a solid cloud foundation, thus giving an edge to businesses with higher cloud adoption maturity levels. In fact, industry analysts report that organizations with high cloud maturity are already focusing on bringing GenAI into production, while others are just beginning to define their GenAI roadmaps. Here are four key ways a strong cloud foundation will help organizations adopt GenAI faster and better: Additional ways cloud enables GenAI adoption include enabling collaboration and sharing and innovation agility. And while FSI moved slowly on cloud adoption for concerns around security, compliance, cost management and others, GenAI offers a strong reason for businesses across the sector to revisit their cloud strategies and implementation roadmaps to be better prepared to adopt GenAI and other emerging AI technology. Realizing GenAI value with cloud maturity progression is critical For the nature of business itself, Financial services, despite the slow adoption of the Cloud, continues to be the industry that may see the most significant value from GenAI adoption. This also highlights the need for the industry to break the resistance to cloud adoption and accelerate the implementation of cloud across their legacy and emerging apps portfolios. Below are several recommendations regarding the priorities that FSI organizations need to focus on to realize GenAI value while they also achieve improved cloud maturity: Financial services organizations are experiencing a hyper-competitive environment already. Emerging fintechs are being stood up over cloud only to have the competitive edge where they can demonstrate agility and innovation at a breakneck pace. The benefits of cloud for GenAI outweigh the risks and prepare organizations to more effectively and smoothly ride the next innovation wave. To reiterate, the need for FSI to accelerate cloud adoption has never been greater, as the emergence of GenAI creates new opportunities for the industry. We use cookies on our site.

Instagram's journey to 100 million users in 2.5 years was a considered a digital marvel, yet ChatGPT shattered this record by achieving the same feat in just six weeks. This scale of adoption is an indication of the transformative potential of GenAI in business. Consumers enjoy the perks of GenAI for tasks like homework, music creation, art, and general creativity without much complexity. Enterprises, on the other hand, face a more complex landscape filled with immense opportunities and significant challenges. In the business world, finance departments are leveraging GenAI for revenue forecasting and detecting leakage. HR is using GenAI to boost employee engagement. R&D departments are accelerating research with GenAI’s rapid data processing and sense-making capabilities. Marketing teams increasingly rely on GenAI for content generation and personalized customer interactions. GenAI use cases are permeating all corporate functions and lines of business. However, the return on investment (ROI) from these ubiquitous GenAI initiatives remains elusive for many. This often stems from an unbalanced focus on rapid proofs of concepts. They solve immediate problems, without a broader strategic perspective. To fully capture the value of GenAI, it's essential to broaden our approach to a comprehensive view that encompasses enterprise value chains, the larger industry value network, and the surrounding ecosystem. Consider the retail and consumer products sector as an illustrative example. Companies now have access to vast amounts of data about customer buying patterns found in both private and public datasets. Retailers can aggregate candid product reviews and consumer advice scattered across YouTube, Reddit, TikTok, blogs, and numerous forums. The insights from both verified influencers and everyday consumers resonate worldwide through various external social platforms. Data on global inventory levels, distribution logistics, and product returns are available across the value network. But how are these disparate datasets being used to drive more precise and forward-looking decisions within the merchandizing and procurement organizations? Are these datasets being used to collect feedback for product design improvements and enhancements? While it might be humanly impossible to achieve such precision, speed, and scale of intelligent action, GenAI agents are ideal for empowering employees and helping businesses derive value from seemingly disparate opportunities across value networks. This wealth of information provides the potential to develop near-omniscient GenAI agents capable of supporting functions across customer service, sales, operations, and beyond. Unfortunately, many of the promising GenAI proofs of concept (POCs) fail to progress to full-scale production due to their narrow focus, limited datasets, and isolated application. Usually, ROI fails, funding runs out, and the POCs are shelved. Small-scale, free-form GenAI playgrounds are an important initial step to introduce the new technology across the enterprise, and they are needed to foster a culture of innovation. However, POCs need a path for scaling into production and achieving a wider field of impact. The success of enterprise GenAI programs is dependent on leadership alignment, an outside-in perspective, IT readiness, agility in execution, and responsible adoption. Here are six simple steps that organizations can follow to transform into an AI-powered enterprise: Successful GenAI-powered enterprise transformation strategies start at the top. An Enterprise AI Steering Committee, led by C-suite executives such as the CEO or CIO, is essential. This committee should also include other key stakeholders like the CFO, CMO, CHRO, and COO, who together lay down the strategic vision and oversee the momentum of GenAI initiatives. Leaders from the value network and ecosystem must be co-opted into the steering committee. Depending on the specific context or enterprise priority, similar multifunctional steering committees could be set up at unit levels. In a retail context, for example, that might mean an Omnichannel AI Steering Committee, a Customer Service AI Steering Committee, and a Supply Chain AI Steering Committee. Meanwhile, the broader Enterprise AI Steering Committee can ensure that the most impactful ideas, tools, and approaches flow freely from one unit to another. The primary role of these Steering Committees at any level is to align GenAI strategies with the overarching enterprise goals and unit level business objectives.  The steering committees must remove impediments that tend to slow down progress and enable a “one team mindset”. Most importantly, the Enterprise AI Steering Committee would be empowered to make decisions on responsible sharing of data and would review and approve proposals for new GenAI programs. A transformation advisor with a strong background in GenAI and industry-specific knowledge is invaluable. This advisor helps bridge the gap between technological capabilities and business needs, ensuring that GenAI solutions are not just technically sound but are aligned to deliver measurable business outcomes. They play a critical role in managing adoption, addressing skepticism among stakeholders, and integrating GenAI into the fabric of the enterprise. Prerequisites for the success of an enterprise GenAI strategy include a robust enterprise cloud strategy and a data consolidation roadmap. A composable architecture will better align with the changing needs of business and C-level business imperatives. Before making significant investments in new GenAI capabilities, a comprehensive GenAI readiness assessment is essential. This assessment should review existing infrastructure, data availability, tooling, and skillsets to identify gaps that need bridging before full-scale GenAI project portfolios are commissioned. It is important to factor in the requirements of entities in the value network and the ecosystem to the extent desired and feasible. Based on this assessment, organizations should develop a phased plan of iterations that deliver measurable and progressively increasing business value. A holistic ecosystem approach ensures that GenAI solutions are scalable and can leverage data and insights across the enterprise and beyond, including partners and customers. This approach will contribute to robust and versatile GenAI applications that deliver value not just within isolated departments, but across entire value chains and value networks. In domains like healthcare, with high levels of regulatory scrutiny, one promising solution is the data hub. Rather than a one-time massive cloud migration, individual datasets can be safely and securely moved into a cloud data hub while other datasets remain in their approved on-premise legacy systems. As the data in the data hub scales, business users inevitably uncover new and unforeseen opportunities to apply GenAI to data in a way that opens new efficiencies and revenue streams. This squad consists of GenAI advocates and leaders from various business units who ensure that GenAI initiatives are relevant, executed well, and adopted in their respective units. They are accountable for the success of their unit-level GenAI projects and the achievement of associated business metrics. They act as liaisons between the GenAI steering committees and the operational teams, fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation. Leadership needs to actively foster a culture that embraces GenAI, focusing on continuous learning and ethical use. Wipro’s own billion-dollar investment in AI, for this reason, includes a provision for scaling AI knowledge and increasing awareness on how to use AI responsibly across all roles. Such efforts should explain the basic functionality and benefits of GenAI, establish metrics for success, and assure that all employees understand their responsibility in this transformative journey. Unit-level AI Academies, meanwhile, can advance continuous learning and certification of employees aligned to their career aspirations and business needs. AI hackathons and AI idea jams will increase active participation from innovation employees and enable the formation of communities of practice. Riding the GenAI wave demands a fundamental transformation in how enterprises operate and innovate. Organizations that approach GenAI adoption through these six steps will enhance their operational efficiency while gaining a significant competitive advantage in the evolving business landscape. This structured approach ensures that GenAI is a foundational element of enterprise strategy, driving long-term growth and innovation. This doesn’t mean slowing down the creativity of the many teams who have been applying GenAI in various niches across the business. It simply means providing talented innovators with guidance, tools, knowledge sharing forums, consolidated datasets, and governance frameworks that consistently allow GenAI proofs of concept to serve the overarching business strategy. This effort will rapidly supercharge and scale the most promising POCs, minimizing wasted effort and harnessing both GenAI and human creativity in sustainable programs that deliver measurable value and desired impact.

Cognizant,Generative AI and the Future of Work | Cognizant,"Americas Middle East Europe Asia Pacific Before generative AI captured the popular imagination in late 2022, the ability to create new things—a competitive analysis, business presentation or piece of software code—was seen as an exclusively human trait. Now, with the showstopping debut of Open AI’s ChatGPT, anyone with a computer can witness generative AI systems respond to a prompt with new content and ideas at mind-bending speed. At first blush, this could seem threatening. But as time goes on, the promise of gen AI will grow increasingly clear: Rather than replace humans, this technology will enhance and augment human intelligence and decision-making, making us better at what we already do. Businesses already can integrate gen AI tools, safely and responsibly, into their workflows. But as gen AI further permeates enterprise technology stacks, it will expand beyond simply automating single tasks. Multiple gen AI agents will collaborate with each other to orchestrate all the processes, systems and pools of knowledge needed to execute a complex series of interconnected tasks, from modifying a product design, to figuring out your PTO based on your upcoming workload. And rather than maneuvering through disparate systems, apps and data, workers will use a single interactive and conversational interface that makes all the necessary connections. In short, gen AI will change how we work by acting behind the scenes to pull together all aspects of the business and provide a unified access point for consumers and employees alike. As gen AI matures, it will make our current levels of productivity seem quaint, while changing—at the deepest level—the way businesses innovate, make decisions and organize themselves. The risks of gen AI are well-documented. Many businesses are hesitant about incurring a major security or ethics breach—not unlike the early days of PCs, the internet and mobile computing. But like those technologies, gen AI will move through its current era of vast disruption to become an unquestioned part of the fabric of work. With due diligence, governance and a phased implementation, these new tools can, and should, be safely deployed without constraining the potential gains in innovation, efficiency and productivity. Leaders who understand the scale of what’s unfolding and begin deploying gen AI safely today stand to gain more than the usual “first-mover advantage.” With gen AI, the potential gains for leading the way in its adoption are as limitless as the possibilities of gen AI itself. From writing FAQs to code, generative AI is already boosting productivity. Even more transformative is what will happen when gen AI agents start to connect and talk to each other. Gen AI can supercharge humans’ ability not only to make and create, but to think. With gen AI embedded in business systems and paired with the right data, decision making will be faster and sharper. To embrace gen AI, businesses will need to reshape organizational structures. Understanding gen AI’s potential issues is key to successfully navigating this new frontier. From starting small to choosing the right model, five tips for deployment success. Gen AI delivers on its promise to improve the way businesses operate and humans work When the world was introduced to gen AI through ChatGPT, what stood out initially was its fluid chat interface that users could talk to naturally. The model would reply with seemingly thoughtful answers, scrolling out across the screen as if typed by an excited friend. But it was what gen AI could do and make from those fluid chats that soon became the bigger story. As distinct from “traditional AI” systems, which react to inputs by following pre-set rules, gen AI models can create information. If traditional AI in a streaming service can recommend a movie you might like, generative AI can, in seconds, write an original movie script precisely tailored to your individual tastes and requests. Or a symphony. Or software code. In our September 2023 survey of senior business and technology decision makers at large businesses in the US and UK, in fact, 61% of executives expect generative AI to result in a complete business transformation. Already, this new technology is hard at work in diverse ways: Some companies are using gen AI to mine their knowledge management systems for meaningful data, which they then use to create new FAQs and guides. If the FAQ doesn’t solve a customer’s problem, gen AI can comb databases for technical info, and even suggest solutions based on similar cases. This frees up human agents to work on more complex customer queries, resulting in a higher level of service. In our survey, 50% of senior leaders said they were already using generative AI to pull data from customer conversations to address customer needs. At Morgan Stanley,  wealth advisors have begun using gen AI to help make investment recommendations and ask general business or process questions, based on its enormous repository of research and structured and unstructured data, including text and video. Pharmaceutical companies are using gen AI to help identify potentially overlooked insights in historical clinical trial data. This could shorten drug-discovery timelines, a breakthrough with major financial implications and even larger potential impacts on human health and longevity. Generative AI can significantly shorten the software development lifecycle. Paired with repositories of code, user requirements and testing scenarios, gen AI can create code snippets, construct user stories that align with business requirements and devise test cases that cover an array of scenarios. It can also create synthetic data, which enables robust testing without relying on sensitive data. In our survey, 61% of execs cited software development productivity as the area where gen AI could play the largest role in their workplace. The productivity gains from gen AI can be particularly dramatic among new or entry-level staff, who can quickly develop expertise that would otherwise take months of experience. This was apparent in a recent Stanford and MIT study, in which call-center reps who used gen AI were 14% more productive on average than those who didn’t. The gains were even greater among workers who had been on the job for less than a few months. Even more transformative is what happens when gen AI agents start to connect and talk to each other. While early discussions revolved around using gen AI for specific tasks, such as coding or creating software, consider a future where those tasks are no longer necessary because, instead, a detailed prompt replaces the need to write extensive lines of code. This new way of interacting with a digital system compels us to question whether traditional apps and websites will even be necessary in the future. As generative AI becomes more advanced, it could usher in an era where digital interaction is far more intuitive, immediate and tailored to individual needs, going beyond what traditional apps and websites can offer. The true revolution of generative AI is in opening doors to these previously unimagined possibilities. Consider that a big reason for the immense, near-overnight success of ChatGPT was its ability to act as a single interface, a “one-stop-shop,” to a vast wealth of human knowledge. That one-stop-shop model will continue as gen AI gains traction, but it will also expand. As multiple gen AI agents begin collaborating, they will act as an orchestration layer, wrapping enterprise systems, specialized data sets, resources and processes into one cohesive unit. For leaders and workers alike, the primary point of contact with the organization will be a conversational AI assistant that functions much like a human knowledge worker, except that it has instant, real-time access to the information and resources needed to do its job in the form of the dataset that’s feeding the generative AI tool.

A typical workflow might go as follows: you need to modify an existing product to enable features for people who have a visual impairment. You ask your gen AI agent to analyze the existing product and suggest some alternatives. None of its suggestions hit the mark, so you provide it with more specifics of what you’re looking for. As the creative juices start to flow, and the product modifications take shape, the gen AI agent continues to help by refining the product, checking it against regulatory requirements, generating blueprints and prototypes and keeping other team members in the loop—all the way through marketing and promotion to launch day. Early iterations of this concept are already in development, with AI-powered task management projects like AutoGPT and Baby AGI leading the way. While they are not without their flaws, these projects offer a glimpse into the future of gen AI assistance. Once mature, this single point of contact model will be more than just a convenience or operational shift. It will completely change how we innovate, make decisions and structure our organizations. Traditionally, productivity gains have flowed from process automation. With gen AI, the gains will also come from innovation, as this new technology supercharges humans’ ability not only to make and create, but to think. Leveraging large language models, for instance, gen AI assistants can summarize, distill and compare books and research papers, vastly increasing the supply of intellectual “raw material” that fuels new ideas—new ideas that can be turned into valuable realities by anyone able to articulate those ideas via prompts and conversation with their tireless, always-interested gen AI assistant. When innovating today, we often have to deal with rigid systems. We must shape our ideas and products to fit the existing tech landscape, with its creaky legacy systems that often do not support groundbreaking innovation. In many cases, we have to focus more on what’s technically possible, on what we can do, rather than on what would truly fulfill our objectives. Gen AI blows through these many technology restrictions. It introduces a flexibility that hasn’t been seen before, as it’s not dependent on strict system requirements and can handle unstructured data. In this environment, productivity gains will flow from innovation, not just by doing the same things faster through automation. The flexibility of gen AI is already evident. The CAMEL project, for instance, has multiple gen AI agents that adopt distinct personas to tackle a problem, as if you’d brought together a mini think tank that includes a microbiologist and a quantum physicist to brainstorm a solution. Ultimately, gen AI promises to be a catalyst for human creativity, not a replacement for it. By effectively extracting and utilizing AI-generated insights, individuals can refine and implement strategies that maximize their own innovative thinking, propelling the boundaries of human creativity. Innovative thinking opens up vast horizons; decision-making determines the outcome. Once an organization incorporates generative AI into its business systems and establishes a unified backend for data access, it can significantly speed up and sharpen strategic decision-making processes. More data driven insights: Generative AI will enable access to a steady, reliable pool of data while also adding layers of depth and usability. LLM-based data augmentation will enrich business datasets, making their AI models even smarter. Gen AI can process both structured and unstructured data, as well as legacy data, where it can identify valuable data points that were previously overlooked. This transforms data from just being available to being deeply accessible and insightful. Consistency is crucial: With generative AI as the interface to business systems, everyone in the organization is working from the same information—gone are the disparities in data sets or discrepancies between departments. This consistent use of data greatly improves organizational performance and reduces the likelihood of errors or tampering, resulting in streamlined and efficient processes. Differentiation through decision-making: Leaders seeking competitive differentiation will embrace generative AI to identify and meet their most significant key performance indicators (KPIs). By identifying the KPIs that set them apart—considering workflows, policies, legacy data and associated analytics—leaders can use generative AI to help them make decisions that help them meet these goals. Generative AI might fundamentally reshape the inflexible, department-based organizational structures that have existed for nearly a hundred years. Just as electrification and industrialization forced us to reimagine how businesses are structured and operate, an AI assistant that can take on and connect many of the tasks of functions like marketing, legal, procurement, operations, R&D and sales will spur businesses to reconsider whether traditional, siloed configurations still work. This point isn’t about needing fewer employees; it’s about reimagining how our current teams operate. By tapping into previously disconnected workflows, applications and knowledge bases with AI assistants, teams can stop working in silos and collaborate to reach goals and make meaningful contributions. Rather than disappearing, jobs will become outcome-focused and reliant on AI to access skills and knowledge. Generative AI will also shake up how we think about organizational roles, as some technical skills become less necessary and other, more specialized capabilities grow in importance. Consider cybersecurity. As bad actors get creative with AI prompts to extract sensitive information, businesses will need professionals who can anticipate these attempts at deception. This means roles that once focused heavily on the technical side of security now require a high degree of creativity and innovative thought. Further, as gen AI becomes increasingly adept at problem solving, it will be up to human workers to get better at problem finding, as they will be the ones to prompt gen AI to find innovative issue resolutions and opportunities. A new diversity of skills will be needed, including an understanding of human nature (sociology, psychology, anthropology), process design and optimization (design thinking, Six Sigma, industryspecific knowledge) and audience engagement, both intellectually and emotionally, through storytelling and design. Moreover, collaboration—between employees with varying skills and between employees and technology—will be pivotal to effectively harness this diverse knowledge. Businesses will need to experiment with flatter organizational structures and devise flexible frameworks that encourage and reward collaboration. As with any emerging technology, generative AI is not without its pitfalls. Understanding these potential issues is key to successfully navigating this new frontier. Generative AI relies on the data it’s been fed to make predictions and generate outputs. However, it sometimes creates outputs that are inaccurate or completely fabricated—termed “hallucinations.” These hallucinations could lead to misinformed decisions or actions, potentially causing significant issues for a business. AI is only as unbiased as the data it’s been trained on. If that data contains biases, the AI can, and will, replicate and amplify those biases in its outputs. Ethical issues can also arise around privacy, a lack of consent or agreement on the use of copyrighted data used for training, and misuse of generated content, all of which businesses need to consider. The adoption of generative AI might lead to some job roles becoming redundant, particularly those involving repetitive or data-heavy tasks. While this could lead to increased efficiency, it also brings up questions around job displacement and the need for re-skilling. It’s important to remember, though, that new tech also creates new roles and opportunities that previously didn’t exist, thereby contributing to more per capita income, more prosperity and more upward social mobility. A recent study corroborates the idea that AI has not resulted in job loss. Economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research found a 5% increase in the number of openings for highly skilled jobs that had been considered vulnerable to AI, such as white-collar office work. The timeframe for the study was 2011 to 2019, the period when businesses started using deep learning to automate tasks. The researchers concluded that new technology can increase demand for more skilled workers even when it replaces those who do routine work. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, recently explained that while gen AI today is good at doing “parts” of jobs, it’s not very good at all at doing “whole” jobs. In the short and medium term, if not beyond, there will always be a human in the loop. As with any digital tool, generative AI systems are vulnerable to cyber threats. As we’ve pointed out earlier, there’s a risk they could disclose sensitive information. The necessity for a robust cybersecurity protocol is clear. Another threat is prompt injection, a technique that coaxes AI models to give away information they shouldn’t and doesn’t always require advanced technical skills to carry out. Security risks, privacy risks and reputational harm were the top three concerns of execs in our survey with generative AI. It’s essential for chief security officers to fully grasp all the ways generative AI could be compromised. It’s only by understanding every avenue of attack that they can maintain robust defenses. The burgeoning and patchwork regulatory landscape around generative AI, with measures like the proposed EU AI Act, presents a significant factor that businesses need to understand and navigate. Nine in 10 execs in our survey said they’re struggling to understand the impact of generative AI on business regulations. Generative AI has the potential to contribute positively to sustainability work, from aiding in regulatory reporting to analyzing data to create innovative solutions. Nearly all execs in our survey (96%) said generative AI would positively impact sustainability because it will democratize technology access. However, it’s important to acknowledge the negative impact of its energy and compute requirements. Similar to blockchain technology, the energy demands of generative AI could cause a backlash. It’s unwise to ignore the risks that come with generative AI. Instead of pretending these risks aren’t there, it’s crucial to establish the necessary safeguards to manage them effectively. This means understanding where caution is required and where safety and security measures need to be in place, all the while taking advantage of the technology’s potential. To effectively do this, you need to: Early adopters of generative AI will have the advantage of better data management and building the skills necessary for successful use of the technology. Understanding your data and AI models takes time, and this time lost by late adopters can’t be bought back, meaning there’s a clear early mover advantage. Identify areas in your organization where the potential impact of risks is lower. This way, you can simultaneously run new methods alongside existing processes. This helps you gradually learn about generative AI while minimizing potential disruptions. Your focus should be on creating an environment that encourages quick experimentation and innovation. The key is to cultivate a culture that’s not afraid to try new things. Different gen AI models excel at different kinds of tasks, and they occupy different points on a spectrum of openness and risk. It’s important to determine what your organization needs to use in order to provide the most value and mitigate the particular risks to your business. Some models are publicly available, yet the data that has been used to create them is opaque, while others are smaller and more niche, based on a particular industry or subject matter and the data can be fully analyzed and understood. Making these choices will inform the risks that are present. There will be two to five large, “general” public models, trained on public, limited private and sometimes indiscriminate data. Organizations will build models themselves, using private IP, to serve a specific purpose or niche. Big players like Microsoft, Google, AWS and OpenAI will offer customizable, fit-for-purpose models as-a-service. It’s essential to understand the data you’re using to train your gen AI models. This includes knowing the quality of the data and any potential risks it might expose internally or externally. Generative AI systems themselves can be used to critique and assess potential risks. For example, you could use them to check if a new output has any ethical biases, or if there’s a reputational risk associated with publishing a piece of content. Ernest Hemingway’s oft-quoted insight that bankruptcy happens in “two ways: gradually, then suddenly” is also how history will likely remember the rise of generative AI. ChatGPT’s splashy debut last November was the “suddenly” part. In the space of mere days and weeks, the non-tech, nonbusiness world underwent a crash course in gen AI, mastering new terminology— “large language model,” “training set”—and speculating, often wildly, about the impact of this new technology on human affairs and society. The lone point of agreement between the utopians and catastrophists was on the violent speed and scale of change: that gen AI, for worse or for better, represents at least an “inflection point,” if not a full “disruption,” in the hitherto smooth unfolding of human history. Lost in the breathless noise we find the “gradually” part. The development of gen AI will likely be an incremental process consisting of decades of continual refinement and improvement. Gen AI’s impact on the world of business and the changes described above will be dramatic and fast-moving, headed in a familiar direction: towards greater efficiency, greater productivity and—most importantly—greater harmony. Yes, as described above, gen AI will break down the walls between departments and functions within a business, helping them work in concert towards a common goal, but this institutional harmony is downstream of an improved and more harmonious relationship between individual human beings and the world around them, a world that gen AI makes much easier to control and navigate. The job of leaders in these coming years will be to keep that harmony in mind and use it as a North Star in making the choices and taking the risks that gen AI already presents. The excitement around this new technology flows from its potential to forge a new, nearly frictionless relationship between human beings and machines. What may matter more, ultimately, when we look back on these turbulent years, is how gen AI helps human beings work with other human beings.

More on our model and exposure and friction scores As generative AI has swept across the global stage, it’s been clear something big was about to happen—to the economy, to business and society, to people’s livelihoods. But how big would the change be? When would it hit? And would the impact be destructive or productive, embraced or feared, unifying or polarizing? Answers are beginning to emerge, and it appears gen AI will be very big indeed. By 2032, according to our research, the technology could inject the US GDP with up to $1.043 trillion in additional annual value—an economic surge greater than the entire US construction industry. We’ll see a spike in gen AI adoption; while as many as 13% of companies could be leveraging the technology in three to four years, nearly half could embrace it in a decade’s time, according to our most bullish scenario. This remarkable projection not only underscores the power of gen AI to enhance, augment and automate many work tasks across all areas of the economy, but also sets the stage for a profound shift in how we approach work, productivity and economic growth. Annual value of gen AI to US GDP by 2032 Businesses adopting generative AI To quantify generative AI’s impact on productivity and the future of work, we partnered with Oxford Economics to create an economic model. The model is calibrated to reveal three scenarios reflecting low, middle and high levels of business adoption. While multiple studies have been published on this topic, we wanted to analyze how this powerful technology could impact actual people, actual jobs and actual careers—and by extension, business productivity and the economy. Our model digs into the 18,000 tasks that drive the US economy, and carefully examines the impact generative AI could have on the 1,000 jobs composed of these tasks. While we focused on the US workforce, the general themes that emerged from the findings can be applied globally. This is because the tasks—and the theoretical ability for generative AI to perform or assist with them—remain the same despite differences in their relative importance and rate of adoption from country to country. See more details on the methodology. What we learned has profound implications for workers—and for the future of work. Our model shows that in the next 10 years, most jobs (90%) could be disrupted in some way by generative AI. Everyone from administrative assistants to CXOs will be affected. In some job families, workers may face months of joblessness as they seek to transfer their existing skills to new roles. In total, approximately 9% of the current US workforce may be displaced by generative AI. Based on an analysis of previous economic shifts, it’s possible 11% of displaced employees—or almost 1% of the total workforce—may struggle to find new work again. Left unmanaged, this level of disruption would have severe consequences for not only organizations and the people who work in them but also for productivity itself. Because achieving the high end of our productivity forecast requires two things: high levels of business adoption of generative AI and low levels of disengaged or permanently displaced employees. And here’s where businesses—and the humans who run them—come in. Addressing both of these factors requires trust—trust between AI makers and AI users, between businesses and policy makers, between employer and employee, and trust in the technology itself. While all these areas are vital, we are primarily focused on the last two, because it’s here that businesses can exercise the most control to maximize the productivity potential of generative AI.

The time is now as gen AI begins to ramp up, for leaders to lay the foundation for a new trust compact, ensuring gen AI is a positive force not just for economic productivity but also for workers and society. If they succeed, we could be entering an age of unfathomable wealth and efficiency. If they don’t, we could be facing a long period of unrest and strife, glimmers of which can already be witnessed among AI makers themselves. Generative AI is a breathtaking feat of technology that could have a substantial impact on society and the economy. But the way it plays out will be grounded in deeply human factors. Will we resist or welcome it? Adapt or stay unchanged? The extent of that impact will be determined by the rate of business adoption and how quickly people adapt to working in new ways. These factors have historically slowed other productivity innovations. For example, microprocessors arrived in the early 1970s, but it took two decades for personal computers to be widely adopted and for productivity gains to materialize. This is why we worked with Oxford Economics to develop three adoption scenarios. If business adoption of gen AI is low, the annual productivity boost in the US could grow to 1.7% by 2032. Even this bearish estimate represents a significant upswing, given that the long-term annual average US growth hovers around the 2% mark. And if adoption comes in at the high end, that figure could soar to 3.5% by 2032 (see Figure 1). From the perspective of total economic output, this means US GDP would see a boost between $477 billion and $1 trillion in 10 years’ time. Three scenarios for gen AI impact on US GDP Generative AI could inject anywhere from $477 billion to $1 trillion into the US economy by 2032, depending on the level of business adoption.

Figure 1 Another key factor that will either bolster or deflate gen AI-related productivity gains is disruption to jobs and job markets. The more disruption workers face, the more difficult it will be to adapt to new ways of working. To understand what that disruption will look like, we analyzed almost 1,000 professions and their associated tasks and calculated a “theoretical maximum exposure score” for each one (referred to in this report as the “exposure score”). A lower score means a lower percent of the job’s high-value tasks will be automated, so people in that profession will be relatively unaffected. For example, those who work on a heating, ventilation and air-conditioning maintenance crew have an exposure score of 5% because generative AI will neither assist with nor automate most of their job tasks. Contrast this with the 62% exposure score for computer science teams—individuals who do these jobs are looking at major change. Explained: Exposure score This score reflects the degree to which an occupation will be affected by generative AI. The exposure score takes into account how many of the job’s tasks could be fully automated by gen AI; how many could be assisted; and the relative importance of these tasks. Through most of the report, unless otherwise indicated, we use the ""theoretical maximum exposure score,"" which assumes immediate and unanimous adoption of gen AI, vs. the ""predicted exposure score,"" which is calculated using the central adoption scenario. 

Example: Family medicine physician Resulting exposure score: 33.3% by 2032 Some impact:
Exposure scores of at least 5% Great impact:
Exposure scores of at least 25% Little impact:
Exposure scores of 5% or lower Source: Oxford Economics and Cognizant
Figure 2 In the past, technology advances and automation largely impacted manual labor and process-centric knowledge work. This time around, it’s different. The script has been flipped; recall our HVAC technician whose job will see little change. Instead, gen AI will change what’s generally called knowledge work—everyone from entry-level number crunchers to seasoned heads of business units to C-suite executives will see their job evolve over the next decade. In fact, our research shows CEOs could see an exposure score of more than 25% by 2032, as they begin using gen AI for everything from reviewing reports and analyzing operations to conducting competitive assessments and making strategic decisions. Even areas long considered the purview of senior execs—cost reduction, program improvement and policy change—will increase significantly in “automatability.” For some people, gen AI-induced change is a reality today. Jobs involving credit analysis, computer programming, web development, database administration and graphic design already have an exposure score of about 50%. By 2032, as the technology advances, exposure scores for some of these jobs will climb to 80%. Other types of workers will experience a surge in disruption as time goes on, as maturity and trust in gen AI lead to more applications of it (see Figure 3). For example, while customer service representatives currently have an exposure score of 11%, that is projected to surpass 63% by 2032. The degree to which a CEO's tasks could be automated could see them with an exposure score of more than by 2032 Chart data reflects “theoretical maximum exposure scores.” See methodology for more on how these scores are calculated.

Figure 3 As the exposure scores demonstrate, gen AI will affect some jobs more than others. Some workers will need to learn how to work with gen AI as it assists with some job tasks, while others will see their roles taken over by the technology. To understand how difficult it will be for displaced workers to find new employment, we calculated a “friction score” for various occupational groups. This score represents the ease or difficulty of finding new employment with existing skills. (See methodology for more on how the friction score is calculated.) Interestingly, some of the hardest hit occupational groups (those with high exposure scores) have relatively low friction scores, meaning their journey to new employment is less complex. High friction score = more challenging to find new work Low friction score = easier to find new work To better understand this dynamic, we plotted an array of job categories by their exposure scores and friction scores (see Figure 4). In this case, however, we used the “predicted exposure score,” which takes into account a more gradual rate of adoption of generative AI, as reflected in our central scenario. As a result, these predicted exposure scores are lower than the theoretical maximum exposure scores used throughout the report, which assume unanimous and immediate adoption. Combining the friction scores and the predicted exposure scores provides us with a clear lens into the disruption ahead. For instance, software developers and database administrators (with relatively high predicted exposure scores of 8%) have relatively low friction scores of about 40, meaning their journey to new employment is less complicated, likely due to their in-demand skill set. But many may face more significant and prolonged disruption from generative AI. Office and administrative roles (such as clerical assistants and receptionists) have a predicted exposure score of 4% but are saddled with a friction score of 80, indicating they will face an uphill battle. US Census Bureau data, which informs our modeling, indicates this displacement won’t be easily solved. Previous periods of change have seen around 11% of displaced workers struggle to find work—taking an average of 39 weeks to find new job opportunities. Disruption at that pace and scale is significant—and if left unchecked could result in trust-shattering levels of unemployment and economic instability for large portions of the workforce. Data in this chart represents predicted exposure scores versus theoretical maximum exposure scores. See methodology for how these scores are calculated. Bubble size represents the relative number of workers in the job category. Color coding of bubbles corresponds to wage quintile in 2022, with darkest blue representing the fifth quintile and lightest representing the first.

Figure 4 At the same time, we also foresee an upside to generative AI workforce disruption, such as its positive impact on ongoing labor shortages that exist in key areas of the economy. For example, in healthcare, ongoing staffing challenges are driving up service costs while dragging down service quality. Our exposure scores indicate that emergency physicians, for example, will see up to one-third of their tasks automated over the next decade—a process that will enable organizations to deliver deliver more healthcare services without the need to ramp up hiring. Another potentially positive impact of gen AI on labor challenges is the way it can be flexibly deployed to accentuate an individual’s existing strengths while softening their weaknesses—in effect enabling a broader spectrum of cognitive capabilities into a wider range of roles. Armed with the right tools, for instance, an equity analyst may not need to be a mathematical expert if generative AI handles that part of the job. Instead, they would perhaps lean on a strength such as communication to add value in the workplace. In this way, generative AI has the potential to significantly lower barriers to entry to a large segment of the economy. Gen AI-driven change will not happen all at once, nor will it follow an evenly paced trajectory. Rather, our analysis indicates it will follow a similar s-curve as other tech advances, such as enterprise-grade software: a gradual rise, to a dramatic spike, to a plateau in which the technology becomes refined and pervasive. This progression will unfold for gen AI as businesses adapt, workers reskill and stakeholders adjust to the societal impact of the technology (see Figures 5 and 6). Adoption of generative AI could move quickly in the decade ahead. Figure 5
Chart data reflects the highest possible adoption rates, as reflected in our high adoption scenario.

Source: Oxford Economics and Cognizant After the 15-year mark, the steep climb slows, but adoption continues to grow for at least 20 more years. Figure 6
Source: Oxford Economics & Cognizant The difference between gen AI and its predecessors is one of pace, scale and the unique societal challenges that must be overcome. In our analysis, there are three stages to this growth story over the next 10 years—each with its own drivers, challenges and opportunities. These stages can and should guide an organization’s approach to making the major institutional changes that will pave the way for a positive and productive embrace of generative AI. The stage we’re in today is characterized by experimentation and cautious implementation. Organizations are tentatively deploying gen AI for tasks that are manageable in scope and low in risk—like image creation, text generation for reports and emails, and code suggestions for developers. For example, our data shows that marketing managers have a theoretical maximum exposure score of 17% as generative AI helps execute tasks such as content generation and market analysis. While our most bullish scenario foresees business adoption of only 13% in this timeframe, the importance of this phase cannot be underestimated. This is the critical time for organizations to explore and commit to major overhauls of their business and operating models, and to begin establishing a foundation of trust with their employees and the world at large. Only with a strong bedrock will organizations be able to drive productivity and lead their markets for decades to come. Low-risk experimentation Gradual adoption Caution and uncertainty Business adoption (“high” scenario) In the next phase, we expect accelerated adoption. Our top-end prediction reveals adoption leaps from 13% to 31% in just four to eight years. Looking at historical examples—such as the gradual infiltration of enterprise software into heavily regulated industries—we can expect adoption to grow based on greater regulatory clarity, more robust skills management, stronger public demand and a greater understanding of how the technology resolves business challenges.

This stage will see a notable rise in gen AI’s role across a range of professions. For example, exposure scores for general managers and operations managers will grow from 18% today to 52.7% by 2032, with the bulk of the growth occurring in this time period. Moreover, the generative AI regulatory environment—currently a mere patchwork—will come into focus. During this stage, gen AI will move beyond mere task automation to become a core component of business transformation strategies. Forward-thinking companies will have developed robust technological infrastructures and a culture that not only accepts but also encourages continuous innovation. Regulatory clarity Lower barriers to entry Reshaped business and operating models Business adoption (“high” scenario) As gen AI continues to mature, we will see an even greater acceleration in adoption. In our most optimistic prediction, we anticipate 46% of businesses will have meaningfully adopted the technology, heralding a new era of partnership between gen AI and decision makers. With a solid foundation of trust established through consistent application and proven reliability, gen AI will assist roles that have traditionally been the exclusive domain of human intuition and experience. For example, our exposure score for legislators hits 37% by 2032. In this phase, the technology is not merely a tool but a collaborator that offers nuanced analysis and strategic insights. This partnership is predicated on the reliability and sophistication of AI systems, which have evolved to understand and anticipate the complex needs of businesses. The data, strategy and culture of innovation fostered in the earlier phases enable generative AI to contribute meaningfully to high-level decision-making, working alongside human leaders to navigate the complexities of modern business landscapes. Widespread use cases Proven reliability Meaningful role in decision making and strategic insights Business adoption (“high” scenario) While the timeframe of this research spans over a decade, leaders have little time to spare as they prepare to get the most out of generative AI. While generative AI promises to boost productivity, its full potential isn't a given. The technology's uncertainties may slow its adoption and impact. Additionally, its influence on the labor market could affect global prosperity and trust. Navigating these aspects is key to realizing AI's benefits. We've established four areas where we believe businesses can lead the charge by forging the levels of trust needed to optimize productivity so businesses, workers and societies can thrive in the age of generative AI. The integration of generative AI into business settings is poised to transform job roles and bring about some inevitable restructuring, highlighting the need for adaptability and continuous learning. However, the fear of layoffs should neither be downplayed nor ignored. Addressing this concern is crucial for fostering trust between employer and employee, and requires proactive and robust measures. No business can guarantee layoffs will not occur. However, all organizations have it in their power to roll out a new generation of reskilling programs at a level never seen before. Rather than being a tactical, optional add-on to an employee’s work life, these programs should be an essential part of the workday. Reskilling programs could take a variety of forms. In some cases, businesses could partner with higher education institutions to continuously revamp curricula in selected skill areas. In others, organizations might collaborate with policy makers, government officials, regulators and even across industries to create shared “academy” systems that would not only teach gen AI skills, but also establish new job tracks for people in roles with high exposure or friction scores. The more robust the reskilling program is, the more it will become a marker of competitive advantage and brand reputation, which will serve to attract and retain key talent. Reskilling could ultimately be so important to a business’s standing that it becomes an area of shareholder scrutiny, with investments and outcomes highlighted in the company’s public reporting. By reskilling even those slated to leave the company, businesses will grow the overall productivity pie by specifically equipping people to succeed and move freely between roles in the new world. They’ll also bolster their brand as a company that’s working with—not against—the vast socioeconomic impacts of generative AI. Future regulations may even require businesses to provide support for displaced workers when it can be proved a job loss was directly caused by generative AI-powered automation. As much as some employees might put off thinking about generative AI and the changes it will require, they won’t want the same from their employers. Employee trust will hinge on whether their employers “get it” and are preparing for the next wave of change. To shore up employee trust, and fully participate in all generative AI has to offer, businesses need to think about how the technology will change how they do business and even the business they’re in. Rather than engaging in quarter-by-quarter thinking, they need to reimagine how they will operate and create value in 10 years’ time. Gen AI offers organizations new ways to earn revenue, improve operational efficiency, innovate products and services and, ultimately, redefine their businesses. For example, infrastructure services companies in the banking sector may find it less lucrative to provide the plumbing for global finance than to enable access to data for client large language models. Or life sciences companies may carve out an efficient and cost-effective path to direct consumer engagement using gen AI interfaces. This type of evolution will require both incremental adoption of new technologies and a fundamental rethinking of business practices, corporate structures and the nature of work itself. From the boardroom to the business unit, organizations should form cross-functional teams that continuously unravel process glitches and revenue roadblocks, and pave new paths into the future. New decision-making frameworks will be needed to quickly assess the best way forward—whether it’s acquiring a burgeoning startup or forming new partnerships. To execute newly-hatched business models, organizations will need a robust technological infrastructure designed to accommodate the rapid pace of gen AI development. Additionally, new governance policies, organizational structures and operating processes will be required to deal with massively accelerated, dynamic and autonomous operations. The companies that prosper will be those that make clear to all stakeholders that they understand the transformative potential of gen AI and make it a central pillar of their strategic planning. Many technologies have roiled the workforce, and all have seen some level of mistrust. But no technology has provoked as much fear and misgiving as generative AI. Whether it’s the technology’s black-box logic or its potential for bias and error, generative AI is simply not universally trusted. Building trust in generative AI requires a clear and demonstrable commitment to mitigating any detrimental effects of the technology on people, society and the business itself. Organizations must be transparent about how gen AI systems are developed and deployed, the values they’re designed to uphold, and the measures in place to ensure they do so. This transparency must show in concrete terms how gen AI decisions are made, and how outcomes serve the broader goals of the business and well-being of customers. There are many ways to establish confidence in the decisions and outputs of a gen AI system. For instance, trust metrics can be incorporated into the application itself by providing visibility into the data the model used to make its decisions. Further, the system could produce a confidence rating in the decision itself. As design of these systems matures, their inner workings will become less mysterious, and overall confidence in AI-generated content and decisions will grow. Organizations must also build in safeguards that minimize the risk of gen AI bias, error and ethically problematic decisions. Using an array of gen AI agents, surrogate predictive machine-learning models, explainable decision models, and human oversight and intervention, businesses can ensure their systems provide non-biased, ethically responsible responses and decisions. If you asked 100 employees how they thought their employer would use productivity gains realized by generative AI, 99 would likely respond with a skeptical—and perhaps historically accurate—response. But given the sweeping change generative AI promises for work and society, the past cannot serve as prologue. Employee-employer trust will only be forged when businesses give at least some consideration to how generative AI benefits will be distributed across society—without hampering innovation and investment. We see this as the next front of stakeholder capitalism. In the same way today’s net zero programs redistribute profits to take care of the planet, tomorrow’s generative AI gains might be shared with employees and society. While there are far less radical approaches, some businesses might completely transform their corporate credo and dedicate a high percentage of their generative AI-driven financial gains to a social cause, as sustainability-minded businesses do now to combat negative environmental impacts. Another possible solution is for those who gain the most from gen AI-related advances to contribute proportionally to a fund dedicated to societal benefits. For instance, investments could be made in educational programs to further support reskilling. Or funds could be earmarked for research into sustainable technologies or healthcare improvements, laying the groundwork for a society that is not only more efficient but also healthier and more resilient. Another potential use of gen AI-related abundance, and surely a popular one, would be to improve employees’ work lives, perhaps by shortening the workday or week. Indeed, many have already begun experimenting with or instituted a four-day workweek. The options presented here are meant to stimulate thought and discussion among business and government leaders, policymakers, community organizers and philanthropic organizations. Each choice comes with its own set of complexities and would require careful planning and implementation. But as with reskilling, it will soon be the case the businesses which think progressively about reinvestment will be seen as trusted brands that are positively engaged in the generative AI age and the productivity it can deliver. When we started our research, the world was grappling with a mysterious advancement that had catapulted from popular curiosity to top agenda item for business and government leaders. For all its potential, generative AI—like many AI tools before it—inspires equal measures of intrigue and aversion, attraction and rejection.  The truth is, for everyone who welcomes generative AI into their daily lives, there’s an equal number who fear the downside of these technologies: their potential to widen prosperity gaps, spread misinformation and reshape the very essence of what we’ve always understood to be human. The questions surrounding gen AI run deep. Can we trust complex decisions made with non-human (and possibly inhumane) logic? Would we rely on an algorithm to have our best interests in mind? Would we feel safe interacting with an entity if we’re unsure whether it’s a person or a sophisticated AI system? Such questions may not be answerable with an economic model. It will take time, experimentation and new levels of trust forged between all who would be impacted, for better or worse, by generative AI. No one will, or should, welcome an engine of economic growth if its achievements are detrimental to a vast swath of humanity, their sense of purpose and their very foundation of what it means to earn a living. The world has the power to usher in a new era of productivity that’s extraordinarily positive for the economy, workers and society itself. This path requires collaboration between the public and private sectors to agree on and uphold global standards of ethics and governance, deliver reassurance on the perceived threats of digital disruption, and educate and empower all in society to thrive amid new possibilities. If those making the decisions, policies, systems and programs know what questions to ask—and answer them with the best interests of humanity in mind—then the potential of gen AI won’t be a dry calculation but a living reality with benefits for all.

Here is a comprehensive explanation of our approach and rationale. The project was executed through five main phases of work that enabled us to develop assumed inputs for Oxford’s Global Economic Model. These inputs reflect how we anticipate the use of generative AI in US businesses will influence structural drivers of economic activity, notably total factor productivity (TFP) growth. To reflect the uncertainty inherent in such a process, we ran three scenarios to develop a range of outcomes. We began by using a US Department of Labor database that contains detailed information on the skills and requirements for approximately 1,000 occupations—a database that now spans more than 20 years—to classify the more than 18,000 unique tasks that must be performed in these occupations into categories reflecting their maximum potential for automation through generative AI. This involved the development and testing of a machine learning model, which we used to generate a “theoretical maximum exposure score” for every occupation. To model possible adoption rates of generative AI, we analyzed precedents from transformative technologies such as steam engines, electricity, automobiles and computers. We also applied a Bass Diffusion Model, a framework commonly used to predict the speed and shape of adoption for new technologies and products entering the market. Using this adoption data, we calculated predicted occupation exposure to generative AI by mapping the theoretical maximum exposure scores to these predicted industry adoption rates. Because generative AI in the workplace will inevitably have a disruptive effect, it is reasonable to expect transitional costs. To build them into the model, we turned to the Current Population Survey of displaced workers from the US Census Bureau. This enabled us to understand the proportion of workers that will be displaced permanently by generative AI and also to generate a “friction score” to determine the degree to which displaced workers may struggle to regain employment. These factors, combined with other, more detailed inputs (noted in the full methodology), enabled us to estimate generative AI’s TFP and labor market participation impacts. The aggregated impacts of generative AI on productivity and employment were modeled as shocks applied to Oxford’s Global Economic Model to estimate the contribution of the technology to US GDP growth above Oxford’s baseline forecasts.

Let’s talk about how digital can work for your business. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the area of computer science that focuses on simulating human intelligence. AI’s true meaning comes from combining rational, emotional and cognitive levels of intelligence across a larger process. AI is ushering in a new age of productivity growth, human and robotic collaboration and, most importantly, the intuitiveness sought by consumers. Artificial intelligence pinpoints areas of opportunity and delivers personal insights that drive innovation. Whether a company is experiencing overall business growth, or seasonal or temporary growth, AI’s predictive and scalable platform allows businesses to respond quickly and smoothly to the needs of their customers and to changes in the market. AI is optimizing and modernizing companies and helping them rethink how they do business. AI is becoming increasingly important in business. It is embedded in many applications by default to leverage features, such as recommendations, next best actions and natural language generation (NLG) based analytics. Employing AI effectively requires a clear focus on applying intelligent technologies to solve tough operational challenges and deliver a lift to the business. Today’s businesses are using AI in many ways. For example: To create a rigorous AI strategy, a company must look beyond technological capabilities. Each business challenge will require different tools, techniques and approaches. Leveraging AI requires extensive experimentation and the ability to apply learnings to the next stage of deployment. Companies need to factor that reality into their plans. A strategy should begin by emphasizing business value/impact and ethical/responsible behavior, rather than the technology’s capabilities and algorithms. ©2025 Cognizant, all rights reserved",https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/services/ai/ai-solutions

of exponential innovation How we arrived here, where we may be headed and meeting the natives The strengths, weaknesses and unknowns of the technology Known and expected use -cases of gen AI in enterprise environments Deploying gen AI solutions in a responsible and effective way Practical guidance for adapting and leading in a gen AI world There’s little question that gen AI has captivated business interest since ChatGPT launched at the end of 2022. Interest has only grown since that announcement and we believe it will transform organizations through new levels of human-machine collaboration. Throughout this guide you’ll find statistics, predictions and perspectives to spur thinking on how to pragmatically apply this technology to innovate. The sense of urgency is understandable given rapid advancements. However, while most companies have actively explored gen AI’s potential through proofs of concept and early-stage experimentation this past year, Cognizant research shows that many leaders (30%) believe meaningful impact is still years away. For most executives we engage, the question is not “if” but “how and when” gen AI will transform their business models and operations. Many are now looking to scale early successes through broader initiatives. Our own research and client conversations this past year reveal enthusiastic curiosity tempered by thoughtful diligence around these emerging capabilities. As enterprises look to transition experiments into scaled production-grade solutions, understandable caution accompanies the excitement. Still, through skills-building and laying responsible foundations in 2023, companies equipped themselves for the next stage of maturity in leveraging AI’s generative potential. 2024 is the year to accelerate AI impact through focus and investment. The rules of engagement continue to rapidly evolve as practical experience refines our thinking on the possible. By working together, we can apply this technology practically and responsibly to increase productivity and deliver superior human-centric experiences. Let’s shape the future together with care, creativity and purpose. The human-like ability of generative AI to converse, consider and create has captured imaginations. By understanding how we got here—and the decades of thinking that led us to gen AI—we can better predict what’s coming next. In the summer of 2022—well before Open AI’s ChatGPT exploded into the public discourse—gen AI began generating media buzz when a recently-fired Google Engineer claimed1 their LaMDA model might be sentient. True or not, this wasn’t an entirely surprising claim for artificial intelligence. We’ve been expecting this. Since Alan Turing’s 1950 “Imitation Game” (Turing Test) proposal, we’ve imagined a future of computers with human-like intelligence, personality and autonomy. Today, we seem to be accelerating towards that disruptive future. If and when we reach sentient AI is anybody’s guess but gen AI presents a significant new milestone in this journey, sparking new interest, innovation and discourse. Here’s how we arrived at this moment. Naveen Sharma Head of Artificial Intelligence and Analytics Practice In the early days of modern computing, the Turing Test and the famed 1956 Dartmouth Workshop launch the era of AI. The first AI programs form and optimism is high. While progressive advances like expert systems proliferate and cultural interest in AI grows, underwhelming results lead to two periods of reduced funding and focus. With the internet and accelerated business digitization, data availability and IT funding expand to drive practical AI applications. Major advances in robotics and data-driven solutions. The Advent of Deep Learning Significant breakthroughs in neural network and generative AI model development, accomplishing previously impossible tasks, alongside surge in big-tech investment. As of Q1 2024, the Crunchbase AI startup list has grown to nearly 10,000 companies2. Change (and more change) ahead In an April 2023 interview with CBS, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai famously commented that today’s generative AI will soon impact “every product across every company.”3 With rapid consumer adoption and the increased competitive pressure created by gen AI across industries, Pichai’s predication is sure to hold true. As gen AI permeates markets, it’s critical that adaptability be built into the technology and cultural fabric of organizations. New, disruptive intra-industry and extra-industry use-cases will arise frequently in the coming years creating continuous change to navigate. A much larger context window
Increasing context windows are critical for many enterprise use-cases and will allow for larger, more comprehensive prompts to be passed to models. This new access to vast contextual datasets will open even more doors for AI. New gen AI models, expanded AI features in enterprise software
Next-gen models are already in development, including open-source models with more flexibility and control. Expect acceleration of new entrants and innovation. Enterprise platforms are adding AI tooling that will drive further proliferation. Waves of regulation and standards
World governments will adopt and adapt regulations at lagging pace as they address rapidly evolving ethical, economic and societal concerns. Organizations will formalize AI governance roles with variable risk tolerance for use cases. Generative video and AR/VR renaissance
With significant advancement in AR/VR technology spearheaded by Meta, Apple and Microsoft, compelling new applications backed by gen AI will launch. With conversational user interfaces (i.e., chat, voice), new visual worlds will be seen. War for talent shifts to war for innovation
As 30% of work hours4 are expected to be directly impacted by AI and resulting automation capabilities, productivity gains will be felt by all. The war for technology talent will be reshaped as a war for technology innovation as organizations differentiate with data. The forever digitally young Operating effectively in the era of generative AI requires a reconstruction of the now decades-old digital maturity narrative. We’re entering a post-digital era where every enterprise is digital and what defines leaders is their adaptability—which extends to their definition of maturity, how they operate and what they sell. The gen AI era is one of continuous, perpetual change. The fundamental definition of computation and chip design is changing with AI as rigid, linear and exact computations are swapped for the abstract and inexact logic that underpins neural network thinking. Companies must now operate in similar ways. So, are there AI natives? As noted in our gen AI timeline, there has been an explosion of AI-centric startups born over the past two years—these might be defined as AI natives. These companies focus on AI and, presumably, they have AI built into their operations and culture as well as their product. But just as our definition of digital maturity requires a ‘continuous change’ perspective, so too will our definition of the “AI-native company”. Being “born into” the gen AI era is far less important than exploration and adoption. Those organizations who pioneer AI—and set the rules early to gain competitive market share from it—will establish what it means to be an AI native. Enterprise organizations, with their robust proprietary data to build upon, have the advantage. Early pioneers have common traits: How are early pioneers applying generative AI? The fundamental strengths of generative AI perfectly mirror its unavoidable weaknesses. The fundamental characteristics of the technology provide insight into its disruptive potential – and explain why adoption will impact every part of the enterprise over time. The blurring boundary between human and machine work Gen AI presents a fundamental change in our understanding of what practical, immediately-accessible AI can do. Chat-bots, candidate screening tools, summarizers and picture-makers might inspire us today, but soon AI will shape the core of modern business. It isn’t sentient but it sure does behave in human ways – and that’s what’s so inspiring about this technology. Whether finishing a sentence, writing the code for a component, ideating on novel molecular structures or animating an entire new movie, this generation of AI composes complex patterns and data to create. As organizations come to understand the strengths and potential use-cases of gen AI, they also begin to realize the fundamental requirements within their organization for fully leveraging this technology. It all starts with data. Combine that data with business processes and logic and gen AI is transformative. Pramod Bijani Head of Digital Experience and Digital Engineering Delivery Complex process automation
Core business processes that, in the past, have not been open to automation due to complexity and variability can now be managed and reshaped by AI Data augmentation and completion
Gen AI systems work with data to provide first-line analysis, classification, sanitization and more, free from human error and at scale Predictive analysis
Gen AI is capable of analyzing complex, structured or unstructured data to identify patterns and trends to form actionable recommendations Driving efficiency and supporting knowledge work
AI makes knowledge work more efficiently by accelerating and expanding on ideation, distilling data to find insights, rapidly drafting and more Real time optimization
Gen AI is capable of monitoring processes and outputs to proactively identify opportunities for improvement, prescribe and even implement changes Multimedia generation
Gen AI is capable of both consumption and creation of rich media across text, audio, video and images, unlocking powerful new possibilities To err is human. For AI, it’s by design. The cyclical evolution of AI over the past 75 years has been marked by periods of waxing enthusiasm and waning pessimism. As new advances promised new opportunities, institutions and businesses have jumped in and invested heavily in the technology. When outcomes haven’t met expectations, though, the AI space has experienced disillusionment and stagnation. By its nature, AI is unpredictable and this is only further highlighted by the gen AI boom and the human-like creativity of its outputs. Like humans and on many tasks, gen AI is capable of working flexibly towards a goal or target output rapidly and creatively. Also, like human workers, context matters. Whether its brand values, ethical considerations, situational knowledge, historical learning, consumer needs or anything else, human workers are expected to understand the context of their work—and this can impact the output of their efforts. With generative AI, contextual understanding is often difficult to achieve “out of the box,” especially with consumer tools like ChatGPT. This has been the source of much of gen AI’s criticism. Its strengths shape its weaknesses Generative AI wants to answer us. It’s built to respond to our prompts—no matter their complexity—and often provides answers that, in a sense, acknowledge this fact. ChatGPT allows us to refresh responses. Image generators like OpenAI’s DALL-E or the popular Midjourney both return multiple images to any single prompt. These tools understand that they may be wrong. The creative muscle of gen AI can be striking, but it is definitely not magic. Gen AI’s capabilities are fundamentally based on reference data and training. AI adoption creates new categories of risk that require focused assurance at the enterprise level. Organizations that engage in this transformative technology with this in mind will gain the most from the AI era. When AI produces unreliable and erroneous outputs, it erodes data-driven strategy, reduces customer trust and limits operational efficiency. Because data shapes AI’s knowledge base, any inadequate data inputs will create bias and limit accuracy, fairness and decision-making. When AI provides a decision, there is inherent uncertainty in its certainty. The larger and more complex a model, the harder to ascertain. Babak Hodjat AI CTO Waiting is not the answer As enterprise decision-makers consider their paths forward in this new AI-enabled world, questions are being asked that are as complex and difficult to navigate as the technology itself. How do we know our AI isn’t hallucinating? What ethical boundaries does this system present? How can we rely on answers, if we can’t explain how our systems reached them? These questions largely mirror the ‘weaknesses’ discussed earlier, and their answers will be shaped through trial and error, learning and time. What’s certain is that readying the organization to navigate this AI-enabled world is critical for future business performance—exploring these questions is a key part of that readiness. We’ll explore near-term steps to take to address these concerns within the readiness section later in this guide. Significant concerns for misuse and harm, bias in poorly trained systems and other negative outcomes of use Cognizant answer: AI creates entire new categories of risk that require focused testing, governance and assurance. LLMOps creates a framework for such responsible usage Concerns for copyright, IP infringement and regulatory issues when dealing with protected data, privacy Cognizant answer: These concerns are ‘native’ to digital business. Processes and tooling can help navigate and safeguard here and every business needs a unique plan Concern over hallucinations, poorly structured or insufficient direction in business-impacting scenarios Cognizant answer: Generative AI can never be expected to provide 100% predictability in output. This is why training, tuning and continuous monitoring must be integrated Concern over customer preference against gen AI in key touchpoints and dilution of brand experience Cognizant answer: As with other AI questions, the key is to test and train gen AI systems well before usage and be selectively transparent with customers about use Consider the early plugins available for ChatGPT, or bots on the Poe app, and it’s clear that the use -cases of generative AI are about as vast and varied as software itself—and those are just chat interfaces. Market and competitor intel Software development Production Marketing and sales Expert advisors Employee engagement Customer experience Even at this early stage, the opportunities for generative Al across the enterprise are countless. With the right foundations, the only limitation of gen AI solution-building may be a company’s imagination. With so much opportunity and so many questions, it can be hard to know where to start. As you’ll find in our discussion of gen AI readiness later in this guide, what’s key is that organizations begin exploring this technology early to identify their own opportunity spaces, safeguard against disruption and begin building skills. Fortunately, there’s no need to start this journey from scratch. With the following seven example use-cases of generative AI, we’ll highlight just how varied the opportunity can be. Every part of the value chain across every industry stands to be disrupted in unique, differentiating ways as organizations bring their unique data, processes and POV to the discussion. Let’s dig in. Turning data into human-readable, actionable and contextualized guidance is a major strength of gen AI. Generative AI systems can be used to industrialize data collection from a range of sources, including curated market research, real-time customer and competitive behavior, internet scraping and primary user research. Whether structured or unstructured, this data empowers systems to drive a range of automated analysis, summarization and recommendations. Summarize and classify

Gen AI learns from loyal buyers to identify/surface trends and formulate full-funnel campaigns Unlike the software solutions of the pre-generative AI world, generative solutions cannot be built, tested, and released into an ecosystem without continuous oversight. Continuous governance is mandatory, and it’s cultural. With all of the compelling use-cases for gen AI and the immediate accessibility of public tools in the market today, it can be easy to get carried away in the AI hype. That same consumer availability of basic AI tooling can trivialize the complexity and downplay the policy, process, partnership and skill required to build tailored, production-grade solutions. Enterprise AI and machine-learning (ML) applications require automation engineering, data management, feature engineering, resource management, QA, and testing teams, IT operations and more; all aligned with coherent, shared accountability in order to effectively deliver solutions. In the following pages, we will explore how LLMOps expands our view of DevOps and how an updated view of quality engineering can safeguard AI solutions with holistic automated testing. It all starts with setting strong, enforceable principles for responsible AI development. Tactical principles for developing gen AI solutions in efficient, safe and value-oriented ways Be robust, be safe AI systems should perform reliably and safely. By building and deploying AI in accordance with best practices where we robustly test before deployment then monitor and improve operations regularly, we can reduce the risk of harm or unintended outcomes. Benefit people and communities Build a more sustainable and inclusive world through AI innovation. AI outcomes must incorporate human benefit and environmental sustainability in order to deliver impact and value to shareholders, users, customers, employees and society at large. Protect privacy and respect boundaries AI systems must be secure, compliant and respectful of people. Affirmative consent and a human-centered, privacy-first approach ensures sensitive data is never used unethically. A variety of auditing systems and safeguards are key within gen AI systems. Design for transparency AI systems should be understandable. Build trust and drive understanding through silo-breaking collaboration and rich communication across users and stakeholders, allowing them to understand AI systems and system outputs within their own, personal context. Promote inclusivity and minimize bias Bias exists in our data, models and our world; responsible AI systems seek to ensure AI is fair, unbiased and representative end to end and full-context. AI systems should treat people fairly and AI should be produced and reviewed by diverse teams. Drive accountability and enable participation People should be accountable and in control of AI systems. Clear processes and incentives for engagement create a culture where every individual is empowered to protect people, minimize risk and discover spaces of humane value. The following two pages provide an introduction to LLMOps but remain too high-level to sufficiently detail the orchestration of people, tooling and processes required to operationalize these practices. To explore more, engage with Cognizant’s generative AI team. Gen AI solutions can be surprisingly seamless. The ability to understand users, act on their needs and provide human-like creative responses is what makes gen AI such a compelling solution today. Behind the scenes, though, gen AI solution development adds layers of complexity to the work of digital teams that go well beyond API keys and prompts. Orchestration is critical. Consider the following difficulties: Due to these conditions, new ways of working are required. Building on the popular concept of DevOps, LLMOps provides a path forward. LLMOps defined: LLMOps aligns data engineering, agent development, software engineering and IT Operations to enable continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous model training with an emphasis on automation and monitoring at all steps. As organizations seek to develop effective generative AI- enabled solutions for internal and external users, defining and enforcing their own LLMOps approach is imperative. This often starts with defining the KPIs of gen AI solutions (aligned to responsible AI principles) and ensuring that processes, governance and tooling are in place—made possible by LLMOps—to monitor and influence those KPIs. These LLMOps KPIs can include: Cycle time: 
Duration from initiation to deployment of gen AI-based solutions Deploy frequency:
How often updates or new gen AI solutions are pushed to production Review time: 
Time taken to review and validate solution (model) outputs and performance Automated solution ratio:
The proportion of tasks handled autonomously by the system Data and model drift:
Discrepancies in solution (model) outputs or incoming data from the training scenario LLMOps and AIOps are often confused, but they describe entirely different disciplines: LLMOps standardizes machine learning model deployment while AIOps automates IT operations. As organizations tiptoe into gen AI, linear solution development processes will be favorable for proof-of-concept development at speed. The belief is that model training is something done early within a process and that a trained model can be utilized endlessly. This can work for testing the waters but is not a sustainable solution. Mature LLMOps processes are iterative in nature with observability and automation at their heart. As a continuous cycle, LLMOps allows data intake and learning to regularly impact the solution while automating as much as possible and keeping humans in the loop. This feedback loop is key to responsible AI development. By ensuring that model behavior, application performance, data protection and system changes are controlled through a technology-driven workflow, organizations can operate more effectively. Andreas Golze Head of Quality Engineering & Assurance Practice The evolved role of quality assurance’s (QA) teams and tooling within the delivery process will be a critical focus area for organizations seeking to deploy LLMOps. While QA automation has become an area of strength for many mature engineering organizations, traditional approaches are insufficient for generative AI. The scope of QA and test automation has changed, with new driving factors to consider for AI-based applications. Preparing an organization for the generative AI world doesn’t mean moonshots and risk, it means foundation laying and learning. Setting up governance now will pay dividends near and long term. Despite the hype around gen AI, we’re still in the early days of the AI-driven business. It’s a certainty that AI will transform every corner of our digital universe and yet we’re continuing to learn how. With new applications conceived daily and development of next-gen generative AI models underway, innovators are fast at work reshaping the future of work. Adaptability in such a rapidly changing landscape is critical. With so much hype and a sea of noise to cut through, many organizations are asking more tactical questions. What must be navigated to move forward? To get practical about gen AI, start with these questions. In the following pages, we’ll double-click into each as we explore a path forward. Provisioned initial access to enterprise-grade gen AI tools? Designed a path to scale successful POCs? Introduced AI to the development process? Modernized and significantly automated core business operations? Set new expectations with our suppliers? In the wake of ChatGPT’s emergence, it’s safe to say that every enterprise was abuzz with cautious excitement about the potential of this new technology. At the individual team-member level, workers around the world began testing generative AI for their own use-cases. A recent survey from The Conference Board found that 56% of workers are using gen AI on the job, with nearly one in 10 employing the technology on a daily basis. Yet just 26% of respondents said their organization has a policy related to the use of generative AI, with another 23% reporting such a policy was under development.6 Organizations have been relatively quick to respond to these risks. Amazon, notably, found7 indication of proprietary data in public model usage and responded with a ban. This isn’t luddite behavior, it’s just good practice. At this early stage, it’s unclear exactly how customer data, proprietary business data and other protected data is either being exposed to the operators of public LLMs or used to train the models themselves. Couple this with the simpler considerations of Privacy Policy adherence, Terms of Service, regulatory considerations and more bans are surely on the horizon. But still, the advantages… As new products go, any amount of friction (cost, risk, etc.) can have a chilling effect on adoption. But generative AI isn’t simply a new product; it’s a transformative technology that can change the world in striking, progressive ways. Early adopters will have the advantage in this new world. Beyond the obvious cultural and process execution benefits of gen AI, we expect a patent boom in the coming years as organizations invent novel uses of gen AI-based tools within their business. Preparing the business for gen AI means getting serious about near-term, safe-guarded adoption with well-integrated monitors and control of usage. Gain advantage while minimizing risk and learn as you go. We’re quite early in generative AI’s diffusion of innovation bell-curve. Early adopters are establishing and quantifying basic use cases—gaining earned media as a result—and most would-be digital leaders are watching with curiosity. In an August 2023 report by Bain and Company8, only 6% of surveyed health systems executives have a clear gen AI strategy in place, yet 75% believe that the technology can reshape their industries. The reasons are the same that we’ve already discussed: uncertainty, risk, lack of inside knowledge and indecision. This lull in early adoption is where the advantage lies. Quietly building a boom To ready themselves for the road ahead, it is imperative that organizations go beyond provisioning access to public tooling and begin developing their own inside use-cases to drive a business case, spark thinking and lay a foundation for future development. This can be done in phased, controlled and protective ways. We suggest two complimentary approaches: 1. Establish and run pilot projects Pilot projects build a ‘light house’ for future innovation and expansion. By establishing specific initial goals for a cross-functional pilot project team to pursue, organizations can create disruptive proofs of concept and establish an internal POV. 2. Enable and accelerate with AI innovation “labs” We have supported multiple organizations on establishing their own innovation lab environments where governance, collaboration and technology enablement are high. These environments become particularly powerful when formed in collaboration with hyperscalers who might provide innovative organizations with access to advanced models, education and specialized tooling. As covered in our section on LLMOps, generative AI development implies systemic changes to the way that software is delivered and supported within organizations. Zooming in, the same goes for software product engineering processes. Here are just some ways that gen AI might impact product development. Idea generation
The ability of Generative AI applications to work with trained models while evolving those models (and the application’s outputs) with the consumption of real-time data can unlock compelling use-cases for product idea-generation. Rather than relying on surveys and user reviews for qualitative data, Generative AI agents might deliver new concepts frequently based on real-time analytics. Product managers can then link these ideas to business goals and set a path forward. Product design
As multimodal models (capable of intaking and outputting images, text, audio, etc.) mature and see enterprise adoption, “clickable prototype” design will become less a job for designers and instead be handled by gen AI tools. Fed with design principles, systems and reference designs, these prototype design tools will produce unbiased prototypes best fitting the market data available. The job of designers will be to identify the most promising solutions and refine them. Risk mitigation
A core responsibility in product management is to manage and mitigate risk. With its predictive analytics capabilities, AI tooling can help in identifying potential risks and roadblocks early on in the prototyping phase. Quality, market readiness and future success can all be gauged by having algorithms analyze historic data, user preferences and even real-time market trends. Resource optimization
Sustainability is the challenge of this generation of business. Generative AI can support sustainability efforts by optimizing resources and material mix for minimized waste and environmental friendliness. It can take regulatory processes into account, report on data and even affect subsequent production processes for both software and physical goods. There is no doubt that gen AI will revolutionize how we work. Process automation has long been a popular use-case in our digital world and AI is going to open entire new opportunity spaces here. The debate around automation will continue to be more focused on how regulators will impose limitations on the technology instead of how much potential the technology affords us. Like media streaming, ride-sharing and other tech-driven economic catalysts that regulators have tried to stay in front of, resistance is a bit futile. Technology will be squeezed for as much juice as it can offer in a free market. In our opening section of this document covering the future of gen AI, we touched on a shift from a war for talent (commonly discussed in the 2010s and pandemic era) towards a war for innovation as all businesses use gen AI to gain efficiency. AI-enabled automation of core business processes will drive this shift. Savings must be reallocated to accelerating business value. 1. Target core functions for AI-driven augmentation

Explore areas for generative AI to support knowledge work and accelerate creativity 2. Assess and expand on existing process automation Apply gen AI solutions to existing process automations to further streamline for efficiency 3. ID opportunities to pre-process data Utilize gen AI to reduce or replace human data processing, gaining speed and accuracy 4. Deploy generative assurance Apply gen AI to business processes to continuously and completely audit quality, regulatory compliance and more By 2032, few jobs could go untouched by generative AI Some impact:
Exposure scores of at least 5% Greatly impacted:
Exposure scores of at least 25% Exposure scores of 5% or lower Most jobs will see some change from gen AI, and over half could be greatly impacted. It’s every company’s job to evolve The early big press-makers of generative AI have been the expected parties. Hyperscalers have introduced new or evolved platforms for building AI solutions within their ecosystems. Myriad ultra-specialized startups have announced compelling new solutions to old problems (e.g., Hyfe’s10 cough sound monitoring for illness diagnosis). And service providers, like us, are launching new accelerators and labs for gen AI development. But generative AI is coming for every product, in every market. That goes well beyond the early adopters and it includes you, your competition and your suppliers. As you seek to leverage gen AI to unlock new efficiency, differentiate experiences, maximize quality, find cost-savings and evolve the business model, don’t discount the role your suppliers will play in these improvements. Whether a service provider, a manufacture or raw goods provider, a logistics service or any other company that plays a role in your operations, there is an advantage to engaging early in a dialogue about gen AI. Every one of your suppliers will be at a different stage of this journey. As they navigate use-cases, seek to answer questions about risks and control and otherwise dive into gen AI, join them. As the innovation potential of generative AI becomes clear to more organizations, the opportunity to create wholly new experiences, services and processes by partnering with suppliers on a joint journey will become compelling for many businesses. Going well beyond the cost savings of a joint investment, with enriched data, access to more skills and beyond, these partnerships might benefit both parties in dramatic ways when executed well. Consider the role of each key supplier within your service or product delivery and move the discussion beyond what they can do with AI for you. You stand to gain from their improvements

Suppliers are critical to your bottom line. Ask how they plan to improve SLAs, decrease total cost of ownership, operate faster and otherwise drive more business value for you and other customers. You will learn from one another As all companies are learning, work with suppliers to understand their own findings, partnerships and interest areas. Formalize shared learning between strategic teams and capture insight. Open the door to more data As you engage with your suppliers, consider internal solution opportunities and how supplier data might improve model training and solution delivery. Bring predictability, new product ideas, streamlined operations and more to life.

January 11, 2024 As gen AI moves into the mainstream, this powerful technology could distribute productivity gains across social sectors and act as a balance wheel for society. Over the past two and a half centuries, the world has experienced five technological revolutions, according to economic historian Carlota Perez. Each revolution occurs about every half century, brings together multiple interrelated technologies and produces profound socio-economic shifts. In the early stages of these revolutions, notes Perez, people often fear that skills, jobs and industries will be upended—and for good reason. Given this long historical pattern, will generative AI, with capabilities so different from any of its predecessor technologies, follow the same trajectory? Will its benefits flow mostly to the economically privileged who already have full access to and familiarity with digital technologies? As generative AI begins to move into the mainstream in 2024, I believe this technology could break that trend and become an equalizer for society broadly. Here are a few reasons why. To begin, generative AI has qualities that depart from prior technology waves, such as its outsized productivity power. In partnership with Oxford Economics, Cognizant analyzed the economic impact of generative AI in the US and forecasts this technology could add as much as $1 trillion to US GDP and boost worker productivity by 10% and total factor productivity by 3.5% by 2032. Increasing the economic pie is broadly viewed as a key route to prosperity for all. Generative AI is also simple to use. In the past, people needed to know a programming language to efficiently use AI. No longer. Knowledge of a natural language is now sufficient to use some of the most powerful AI tools available. As AI expert Andrej Karpathy observed, “the hottest new programming language is English.” Therefore, solving problems using AI has become much easier and more broadly accessible, aided also by the ability to use some forms of generative AI for free, such as Microsoft Bing and Google Bard. No question, as generative AI is adopted increasingly by businesses, workers will face a major adjustment. Last year, most workplace tasks could not be assisted or automated by generative AI. But by 2032, Cognizant’s research predicts that generative AI could be capable of both influencing a greater share of tasks and automating them to a greater degree. Our research shows that over the next 10 years, 90% of jobs could experience some degree of disruption. Everyone from entry-level number crunchers to heads of business units and even C-suite executives will see their jobs evolve over the next decade. But in contrast with prior computerization waves, the productivity gains associated with generative AI seem to go disproportionately to less experienced, lower skilled workers. In a recent National Bureau of Economic Research working paper titled “Generative AI at Work,” the authors (Erik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li, and Lindsey Raymond) conclude that generative AI benefits the less skilled because “gen AI systems work by capturing and disseminating the patterns of behavior that characterize the most productive [customer support] agents, including knowledge that has eluded automation from earlier waves of computerization.” Generative AI seems to speed individual learning by enabling novice workers to progress more rapidly along the experience curve compared with those who don’t use this capability. Likewise, a working paper from MIT titled “Experimental Evidence on the Productivity Effects of Generative Artificial Intelligence” suggests that “inequality between workers decreases as ChatGPT compresses the productivity distribution by benefiting low-ability workers more.” If, as this early research suggests, generative AI may asymmetrically benefit the less skilled and less productive, what societal changes could result? We can recall educational reformer Horace Mann’s observation that “education, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance wheel of the social machinery.” Could generative AI become a new balance wheel of society? I believe so, especially if we can demystify how generative AI works, be transparent about how and where it’s deployed, commit to mitigating any detrimental effects of the technology and, above all, roll out a new generation of reskilling programs on a vast scale. How might this happen? Rather than an optional add-on to an employee’s work life, reskilling will need to become an essential part of everyone’s workday. Businesses could partner with higher education institutions to continually revamp curricula in select skill areas. Organizations could collaborate with policy makers, government officials and regulators to create shared “academy” systems that would not only teach generative AI skills but also establish new job tracks for people in roles where many tasks are likely to be fully automated by generative AI. Keep in mind that generative AI can be deployed flexibly to accentuate people’s existing strengths while deemphasizing their weaknesses, thereby enabling an array of cognitive capabilities to be used in a wider range of roles. Building greater trust in AI will also be crucial to ensuring its beneficial effects prevail. That’s why Cognizant recently surveyed 1,000 US consumers to discern how the level of trust and understanding of generative AI affects how they perceive this technology. While split between enthusiasm and concern, consumers are overwhelmingly positive that generative AI will make other technologies easier to use. More than half said generative AI will increase access to innovation and benefit education. And more than half also agreed that getting high-paying jobs will be easier because people can use the technology to supplement and boost their skills. The majority, however, said the widespread use of generative AI could result in greater competition for jobs—perhaps a sign of generative AI’s ability to democratize skills. Recognizing generative AI’s potential to greatly expand our knowledge, skills and productivity, it seems this technology could, over time, bring many more people into more highly compensated work. Aided by a generative AI assistant, we can imagine a nurse taking over more tasks from doctors, while doctors have more time to focus on complex medical cases and intensive patient interaction, enhancing the overall quality of care. To be sure, we are early in generative AI’s evolution. Still, the optimist in me believes this technology could significantly boost social mobility by bridging the longstanding digital divide and providing more people with access to well-paying jobs, while shrinking the wage premium granted to the most credentialed. As a corollary, generative AI may also depress the compensation of some jobs held by the most educated by automating the knowledge work that used to be their exclusive domain. Therefore, by raising the socio-economic floor while lowering the ceiling, perhaps generative AI may, over time, become the new balance wheel of society.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. January 10, 2024 Generative AI could inject $1 trillion annually to the US economy by 2032, according to our recent research. But whether it reaches those heights—and at what cost—will be determined by businesses and the very human decisions of the leaders who run them. Generative AI will have enormous implications for the future of work and productivity. But how massive an impact? And with what results for people and jobs? In our recent research, the answers to these questions were staggering. We partnered with Oxford Economics to create an economic model that would quantify generative AI’s impact on the future of work. The model digs into the 1,000 jobs and 18,000 tasks that drive the US economy and examines the impact of generative AI on those occupations and the people who work in them. While we focused on the US workforce, the themes that emerged from the findings can be applied globally. The model is also calibrated to reveal three scenarios reflecting low, middle and high levels of business adoption. Here’s what we found: Left unmanaged, this level of disruption would have severe consequences for not only organizations and the people who work in them but also for productivity itself. Because achieving the high end of our productivity forecast requires two things: high levels of business adoption of generative AI and low levels of disengaged or permanently displaced employees. And here’s where businesses—and the humans who run them—come in. While the story of generative AI’s impact on work and productivity is technology oriented, it will ultimately be written by human hands. What it will take to reach the highest levels of business adoption and the lowest levels of displaced employees is the very human element of trust: trust between employer and employee, and trust in the technology itself. Because for everyone who welcomes generative AI into the workplace, there’s an equal number who fear the downside of this technology: its potential to disrupt livelihoods, spread misinformation and reshape the very essence of what we’ve always understood to be human. The time is now, as generative AI begins its ramp-up, for leaders to lay the foundation for a new trust compact, ensuring the technology is a positive force not just for economic productivity but also for workers and society. By embracing the following tenets, organizations can take crucial first steps to bolster confidence, build trust and open the door to a new age of productivity and prosperity: Answering the many questions raised by generative AI will require time, experimentation and intellectual honesty. If those making the decisions, policies, systems and programs tackle this challenge with the best interests of humanity in mind, then the potential of generative AI won’t be a dry calculation but a living reality with benefits for all.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. June 27, 2023 Data engineers are to gen AI what coders are to software. Their future will be shaped by harnessing the power of this transformative technology. Data engineers have long been the unsung heroes of modern business. Many of the most dazzling achievements of the digital age have relied on the work of people toiling behind the scenes to build and maintain the data pipelines, databases and infrastructures that store and analyze the ever-rising tides of information that define today’s competitive landscape. But today is becoming tomorrow, and life is changing fast for the humble data engineer. The arrival of generative AI in data engineering has already transformed the day-to-day work of wrangling data. With its ability to automate many tedious but manual processes, generative AI frees engineers’ time and attention for higher value tasks. In our September 2023 survey of senior business and technology decision makers at large businesses in the US and UK, in fact, 61% of decision makers cited software development productivity as the business area where gen AI could play the largest role in their workplace. Not only that, but the unique importance of data engineering to AI itself is about to give these unassuming specialists a new and central role in the business ecosystem—unsung no longer; heroes more than ever. Generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) refers to the new breed of AI models that can generate original content based on the patterns and structures learned from huge troves of existing data. The best-known example, for now, is OpenAI’s GPT-4, a natural language processing model that can generate fluent, coherent and contextually relevant text based on user input. Other gen AI models work in the visual medium, and the most obvious, immediate value of these technologies to data engineers is that it will let them produce high-quality charts, graphs and reports from a data set without (necessarily) enlisting the help of human designers or even analysts. The core purpose of data engineering has always been to lay bare the trends and meanings within a data set. However, Gen AI in data engineering has the potential not only to help identify those trends and meanings, but to also present them with such clarity that non-technical minds can grasp them in an instant. But the “creativity” of data engineering has always been about more than charts. The work requiring the most inspiration, abstraction and “what-if” thinking is the design of data infrastructures themselves. Here too, gen AI can provide a huge boost. As models become more advanced, they will be able to tackle these more complex data engineering tasks, from schema generation to feature engineering. Already, though, simply by automating much of the technical drudgery of data work—coding, for instance, or system maintenance—gen AI is freeing up data engineering professionals to spend more of their time and creativity on high value work and more abstract thinking. In addition to gen AI’s potential to help data engineers better manage the flow of existing data, this technology can also create new data. The appeal of this may not be obvious to a business already drowning in information—struggling with the challenge of converting an unmanageable “data swamp” into a less daunting “data lake,” say. However, there are several key areas where new data can directly drive growth and aid decision-making. Much has been written about the potential dangers of generative AI, and being a product of data engineering itself (see below), any and all of gen AI’s problems are ultimately problems for the data engineer. However, when considering the use of gen AI within data engineering, some of these hotly debated risks are likely less of an issue than they are for other fields, while others may be more worrisome. Take the issues around bias and copyright. From the moment Chat GPT-3.5 brought gen AI to mainstream awareness last November, anxious observers flagged some glaring ethical concerns. Because the model was trained on a vast quantity of human-generated text, much of it scraped from the internet, there was a risk of its output directly copying a single human writer’s work without attribution or compensation. This raised the more philosophical question of what, if anything, is owed to the whole class of human writers who, without consent, provided the raw material on which the model was trained. More disturbing was the reality that bias and prejudice within the training set, and the unconscious bias of those developing the model, could help perpetuate or even amplify those injustices in the real world, and thus in future data sets. Data engineers need to be mindful of these issues; a set of raw numerical data can be as tainted with bias as any collection of words. For the most part, though, in the abstracted world of big-data infrastructure, it is more difficult to give offense, and numbers will never equal words or pictures in their capacity to wound or shock or denigrate. The questions around model transparency, however, may pose more of a challenge to data engineers. Generative AI models, particularly those based on deep learning techniques, can often be functional “black boxes.” They can take input in the form of a natural-language prompt and, from it, produce content that is also digestible by human minds. In many cases, though, the chain of “reasoning” between those inputs and outputs is utterly opaque, conducted in terms that only the model understands. For, say, a graphic designer using an AI image generator, this may not be a problem—artistic inspiration has always been mysterious, after all. But for hard-nosed data engineers, whose work has always required them to understand, and be prepared to defend or duplicate, the logical chain between input and output, the impenetrability of generative AI may pose a particular challenge. Developing techniques to improve the interpretability and explainability of generative AI models will be crucial to their widespread adoption and integration into data engineering workflows. All of which is only to say that gen AI in data engineering is going to have the same kind of impact on data engineers as it’s going to have on so many of us: a profound one, changing not just how we work, but what our work even is. What makes data engineering unique in this regard, however, is that data engineering is literally where generative AI comes from, and what makes it tick. All the dazzling power of large language models, and their equivalents, comes from the awesome size of the datasets they use to train, and the systems that sift, analyze and weight that data into the billions—even trillions—of parameters that a model applies in order to produce fresh content. Put another way, data engineers are to generative AI what coders are to software, or what mechanics are to cars, and their importance is set only to increase. By some predictions, we are less than a year away from fully 60% of the training data for gen AI models being synthetic, which is itself the product of gen AI, midwifed into existence by data engineers. The next few years, in short, are going to be a wild ride for specialists who today, in the public imagination, are still primarily tasked with turning last year’s Q4 sales data into a pie chart. As professionals in every field adjust to life as the flesh-and-blood member of a human-machine partnership, it is data engineers, increasingly, who will be the matchmakers, chaperones and couples-counselors of those relationships. It’s no exaggeration to say that humanity’s immediate future will be shaped directly by data engineers. And the future of data engineering, conversely, will be shaped by those who are best prepared and most willing to harness the awesome power of this transformative technology.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. April 03, 2024 Generative AI will boost the importance of critical thinking and meaningful human interaction—demanding a rethink of the workforce skills of the future. We talk with our clients every day about the ramifications of generative AI. Many conversations focus on leveraging generative AI for productivity gains and—for those more confident in their AI abilities—using it for customer-facing interactions to drive sales and service. However, there’s also an opportunity to examine its impact on people: the new skills they’ll need and the ways it will shape our interactions with each other. As our research with Oxford Economics shows, nearly all jobs will be affected by generative AI in 10 years’ time, and as many as 46% of businesses will adopt the technology in the next decade. The ramifications for the workforce—and for needed workforce skills—will be enormous. Consider that in the most mainstream use case, generative AI acts as an assistant—curating and analyzing a vast amount of knowledge to share insights and generate recommendations. An example is a sidekick to a call center agent. Typically, agents have to put clients on a lengthy hold while they search for information to answer a question; with generative AI serving up quick summaries and recommendations, that wait time is reduced. But, as we all have learned, generative AI is fallible. It can hallucinate feelings, make up information, respond with bias and be tricked into sharing information it shouldn’t. It requires a second set of eyes to elevate its thinking or guide it back on track—much like a new graduate starting their first foray into the professional world. Or as the Board of Innovation puts it, generative AI will turn many of us from creators into editors. In this way, these AI tools will act as our automated digital interns, requiring humans—even those entry-level new grads—to become effective “editors” or managers. To manage the shift, enterprises will need to prioritize change management and employee education much more so than they have in the past. Here are a few of the human skills that will need to be honed in the workforce as AI solutions become more pervasive in the enabling digital ecosystem. The rise of generative AI has caused a land rush of prompt-engineering tips and advice, typically comprising formulas or patterns of questions aimed at getting the best results from large language models. Engineering a prompt essentially means workers are learning to manage their AI interns (such as Microsoft 365 Copilot, Miro’s AI Assist and developer productivity tools). Doing so requires the same type of critical thinking and problem-solving skills managers use to effectively elevate work products. To engage with AI, users need to break down a question, or prompt, into its component parts: the sources from which information might come, the lens or persona through which it should be ingested, and the parameters that should shape the output. Once a response is delivered, the user will need to create additional prompts to refine or improve the quality of the response. This kind of critical thinking is now table stakes for new graduates, who lack the experience to instinctively know when a response is enough (i.e., “what good looks like”). As we think about future skills and how to cultivate them, the following questions come to mind: Repeated exposure to tools that require prompt engineering could have consequences. As we learn how to provide directives to our AI interns, we will build muscle memory for that kind of interaction—and unintentionally limit ourselves to command-and-response exchanges. Without practice or more exposure to other types of communication structures and tones, we risk losing the ability to relate, debate and converse with each other. Why does this matter? Because with the brevity and impersonal interactions with AI, it will be difficult to build the psychological safety and emotional trust critical to effective team collaboration. As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says, empathy—widely considered a “soft skill”—is actually “the hardest skill to learn.” This raises questions for business leaders seeking to build generative AI capabilities into their organizations: With businesses intent on driving efficiency through digital technology, it is often assumed that any task can be performed faster and better that way. At the same time, many business leaders we speak with are assessing which tasks are lower risk and more easily executed by AI, and which sit outside AI’s current capabilities—what Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar refers to as the “jagged technological frontier.” Similarly, the pressure of meeting productivity targets needs to be balanced against both the promise and limits of AI. For instance, many creative or relationship-oriented roles require people to contextualize information to the specifics of their organization, or to understand cultural or regional nuances. Making those connections can take time. But as AI enablement becomes more pervasive, throughput expectations will accelerate. With the push for high-quality output delivered quickly to achieve productivity goals, businesses risk underestimating the necessity of human input. While organizations explore generative AI use cases, questions arise: Generative AI will boost the importance of critical thinking and communication skills—demanding that we rethink workforce skills of the future. As we continue to work with and build AI solutions, we encourage our clients to view the effort through a combination of human-centered design and traditional business rationale. We also advise them to ask questions similar to those outlined here.

January 27, 2025 Impatient for returns on gen AI investment? Here’s how to speed things up. This content was originally featured in a Fast Company article in January 2025. The impact of generative AI has been immediate and powerful, but it has presented leaders with a dilemma. Our research shows that while leaders expect AI to pay dividends in four to five years (48% of survey respondents are piloting AI initiatives with that goal), they also expect it to affect revenue negatively over the next two years (42% anticipate a negative impact in that timeframe). Investment always takes time to pay off, by definition, but given the newness and strangeness of gen AI it’s perhaps not surprising that some companies are hesitant about making a heavy investment now in this new technology. They shouldn’t be. Gen AI’s killer app, largely untapped so far, is revenue creation—unlocking the value already trapped within organizations and business models, often due to outdated processes or models. Businesses that embrace this vision will see their early investments pay off significantly, while companies that fail to act now risk falling behind. In these early stages of leveraging gen AI, leadership is everything. CEOs, COOs, and other members of the senior leadership team must set the agenda and drive the business to unlock value in a strategic way. Let’s explore five key areas in which to do so. Netflix revolutionized the entertainment industry, first by bypassing the bricks-and-mortar stores that sold and rented DVDs and VHS tapes, then by cutting out the need for physical media altogether. Netflix didn’t just digitize the renting of movies, in other words; it thrived by eliminating whole links from the entertainment-delivery value chain. Generative AI can facilitate that process within any business by automating workflows and interactions, resolving inefficiencies, and shortening the time between service and customer outcomes. In the healthcare sector, for example, AI chatbots can streamline patient intake, making physical paperwork obsolete and accelerating treatment. Similarly, insurers can use AI to automate claims, providing real-time decisions without involving human adjusters. By removing friction points, gen AI can help businesses deliver value faster. In 2013, Microsoft began transitioning Office from licenses to a subscription model. This was a shrewd reading of the value chain and market conditions. Now you can buy everything from coffee pods to cat litter to word-processing software on a subscription basis, and gen AI will push this trend much farther. Because gen AI allows for ongoing personalized and adaptive experiences, subscription-based business models will become a more plausible option for companies across the business landscape. Many large automakers are already looking at embedding gen AI in vehicles—seeking revenue streams beyond the core product by providing subscription-based services like advanced driver-assistance systems, enhanced navigation, even automated parking. Gen AI made this trend possible, and gen AI is going to accelerate it: analyzing relationships among billions of seemingly unrelated data points to discover features and services consumers are willing to subscribe to. With new subscription revenue streams identified, gen AI will then market them to consumers at a granular level. In the mid-2010s, a slew of fintechs and digital-native insurers—Oscar Health and Lemonade, for example—bypassed brokers and delivered direct-to-consumer solutions. More businesses should consider using AI to bypass traditional channels. Gen AI makes disintermediation—a fancy term for cutting out the middleman—more feasible by allowing businesses to create personalized, automated, and scalable customer interactions without relying on human intermediaries. Think of retailers who can, already, create virtual shopping assistants to engage directly with customers, providing personalized styling advice, diminishing the need for retail partners and sales agents. Likewise, banks and insurers could consider creating AI-based lending advisors that analyze customer data and recommend loan structures, bypassing traditional financial agents. And disintermediation isn’t just for consumer-facing businesses. Consider the myriad interactions between, for example, healthcare players (physician to insurer, lab to physician, specialist to lab, etc. Each of these interactions presents a potential opportunity for disintermediation, and every industry has its own plethora of contact-points that gen AI could, in many cases, remove. In the early 2000s, premium car brands began adding features like GPS and in-car entertainment to differentiate themselves from competitors and to justify higher prices. These features enhanced products without replacing them, adding value over time. Across industries, generative AI will replicate this pattern, enabling ongoing improvements that justify premium prices. For example, Bloomberg is using AI to improve its Terminal product, generating more accurate insights more quickly. Many e-commerce platforms now feature AI-powered recommendations, and newer phones have automated image editing. Gen AI-propelled product enhancements will really take off once major players within industries begin putting pressure on one another. When Competitor X invests in the technology and gains market share, Competitor Z will surely follow suit. Amazon Web Services emerged from Amazon’s struggle in the early 2000s to scale its own tech infrastructure. Realizing it was already very good at building reliable data centers, the company spun AWS into today’s $100 billion business. As gen AI alters the value of links in the value chain, other companies will similarly capitalize on assets in new ways. In some cases, the asset in question will be data, as in infrastructure services companies, for example. Trusted, consistent, anonymized information could soon skyrocket in value. The opportunities I’m talking about won’t materialize without bold leadership and strategic vision. Companies that want to lead in their sector need to advance beyond pilot programs and tapping isolated pockets of productivity. They need to think big and move toward full-scale AI adoption. Here are guidelines for beginning this journey: While gen AI’s lack of immediate ROI may bring risks, being an early mover is essential. Leaders who take their initiatives to the next level now will shape the future landscape, setting the standard for those who follow. Generative AI presents a unique opportunity to unlock new value. Businesses bold enough to take the leap today will emerge stronger in the long run. Yes, this requires vision and courage at the top, but the rewards—new revenue streams, reimagined processes, and competitive advantage—are well worth the effort.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. January 30, 2023 Doing business in the age of creative machines. Unless you’ve been living under a rock since November, you’re probably familiar with the term generative AI. This startling technology, which harnesses the data-crunching brawn of artificial intelligence to generate original text, images or other content is already being talked about as the next great technological revolution, a world-changing upheaval to rival or even eclipse that of the Internet in the 1990s. Last week in Davos, Switzerland, generative AI dominated discussions at the World Economic Forum, with giddy business titans and tech gurus touting its potential to transform not only how we communicate and entertain ourselves, but the way we think, make decisions, and even wage war. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke glowingly of generative AI’s potential to democratize the creative process, enhance human productivity, and help those short on resources ‘do more with less.’ Not everyone is excited. Even before Open AI released the jaw dropping ChatGPT 3.5 chatbot, some artists and writers, fearing for their jobs, were campaigning online against galleries and platforms that showcased generative AI content. Looking forward, it’s hard to see how generative AI won’t soon also be replicating the work of journalists, programmers, copywriters and more. For those who like their nightmares quantified, this month’s Atlantic cites an Oxford University projection that precisely 47% of U.S. white collar jobs would disappear in a fully generative AI-fied world. Who’s right? When the dust settles from phase one of the generative AI revolution, will history have vindicated the utopians or the doommongers? It’s way too early to say. But we can, already, venture some educated guesses as to what this technology may mean in the medium- to short-term for businesses, employees, and customers. Before generative AI can generate anything, it does what all artificial intelligence does: train itself on a large set of existing data, taking note of recurring patterns and correspondences. Those observations are compiled into an index of rules and parameters called a ‘model.’ Though the model cannot think, the sheer volume of data at its disposal, coupled with godlike processing speed, lets a conventional AI model spot patterns and find meaning in subsequent sets that would elude even the smartest, most experienced human analyst. But a generative AI model doesn’t feast on fresh data sets—not big ones, anyway. It takes its input in the form of a short ‘prompt’ from a human user (example), then uses its vast learned index of rules, facts and principles to produce content that conforms to what the model has taught itself about human tastes and expectations. Before ChatGPT went prime time in November, image-generators like Dall-E, Stable diffusion and Midjourney were dropping jaws online with incredibly detailed and dare we say it, even beautiful images, prompted either by snippets of text, or images, supplied by the user. Figure 1 Figure 2 These products use different AI models to produce content in different mediums, but the principle is the same: the AI trains itself on a huge dataset of existing material—literal billions of artworks harvested from the Internet, in the case of Dall-E—then uses human prompts to generate new, original material that the user can then tweak and refine ad infinitum with more prompting. As the framework of using a data set, user prompt, and AI to generate new content continues to evolve, models are springing up that can produce work in other mediums, such as 3D assets for virtual environments. OpenAI has even developed a functioning, if unrefined, music generator called Jukebox. So why does ChatGPT get all the headlines? It didn’t, initially. OpenAI’s first white paper on the power of Generative Pre-Training dates to 2018. Even after Microsoft announced in 2020 that it had licensed exclusive use and access to the GPT-3 model, discussions of the news were still largely confined to AI blogs and tech-investor Subreddits. However, in 2022, the model started learning in a new way, using so-called ‘human preference training’ to incorporate the feedback of actual flesh-and-blood users into its learning loop. The results were immediate, and startling. The version of ChatGPT released in November—version 3.5—had fully cleansed itself of its predecessor’s stiltedness and could write and converse with a remarkably human fluency. Figure 3 Within weeks, a million users had signed up for free Chat GPT accounts—the system is currently not accepting new users—and discussions of generative AI’s potential made the leap from tech blogs to mainstream publications like the Washington Post, which by January was dispensing such deep-in-the-weeds advice as “How to use ChatGPT to text or Tinder without being a jerk.” Generative AI, in other words, has already changed the texture of people’s lives—if only in the wild proliferation of content being created and shared on social media. But the applications for big business could be even more profound. As with any new technology, generative AI’s first wave of users are still wallowing in its novelty, and experimenting to test its limits, but more stable, scalable, and commercial products are already in development. First to market have been products such as avatar creators and copywriting tools, but larger-scale, industrial and consumer applications are sure to follow. Here are some potential ways in which generative AI will likely scale and reach a wider audience: All the above comes with no small amount of risk, for humanity as a whole in the long term, but more immediately for businesses itching to put generative AI to work. While the technology is impressive, it is far from perfect. The current data set is static, it does not know that Queen Elizabeth the 2nd has died, for example. And when generative AI does make mistakes, what’s more, its tendency is to be ""confidently incorrect,"" promoting falsehoods and misinformation with the full weight of its deep knowledge base and its newly acquired talents for persuasion. This is a significant concern given the inherent biases that have already been detected in some AI models and will only be amplified as gen AI expands in its reach. Some artists have questioned the legality of having their work used to train AI that may ultimately replace them, simply because their images have been uploaded to the internet. Although the generated artwork does not violate their copyright, the AI would not be able to function without the initial information it has been trained on. Similarly, text generated by AI may repeat ideas it has been trained on, potentially causing problems for users if the output is published, even though it is not necessarily plagiaristic. These issues have led to calls for watermarks on AI generated content, with China even banning content that does not have one. And then there’s the biggest risk of all: the sheer unknowability of what life, society and business will be like when ""the generative AI revolution” becomes an upheaval we can look back on as an event with something resembling an end point. On this, it’s hard not share both the excitement of the Davos visionaries, and the concerns of white-collar knowledge workers staring down the barrel not only of job loss unemployment, but of irreversible obsolescence. Yet the case for a cautious optimism is compelling. Yes, generative AI holds the promise to be something more than just another technological revolution—never before has it felt like the essential nature of being human was on the table, our ‘specialness’ as a species up for grabs. But a revolution in technology it will be, nonetheless, and technology has an essential nature of its own: enhancing the ability of humans to do the things they do best. Will the coming revolution prove the first exception to that so-far unbroken rule? Probably not—and at this point, there is no going back. The gen AI is out of the bottle.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. March 19, 2024 Our recent survey shows women are more wary than men when it comes to gen AI and jobs. A closer look reveals the data behind the heightened concern—and ways to safeguard women from the negative impacts of gen AI. Many people in the workforce are wary of the effect generative AI will have on their jobs. And little wonder. According to our economic model developed in partnership with Oxford Economics, 90% of all jobs could be impacted by the technology over the next decade, with half being significantly affected. But our data also shows that one segment of the workforce could be particularly affected: women. And they seem to know it. In our recent pulse survey of 1,000 US consumers, more women than men believe generative AI will negatively impact their work in a variety of ways (see Figure 1). Figure 1
 Source: Cognizant Our New work, new world study further shows how female workers could see an unbalanced share of the risk from generative AI. The occupations in which women tend to predominate will, in fact, be more greatly disrupted by generative AI, if not eliminated altogether. To understand this phenomenon, it’s vital to consider that historically, technology-driven revolutions tended to displace employees in jobs traditionally categorized as blue-collar. Think of assembly-line workers replaced by robots. With generative AI, however, those at highest risk of disruption or displacement perform knowledge work, also known as white-collar jobs. Ironically, women’s enormous gains in white-collar work may now make them more exposed to disruption. According to research published by Goldman Sachs, 79% of working women—compared with 58% of working men—are employed in occupations susceptible to generative AI disruption and automation. This is because a higher percentage of working women are employed in white-collar jobs than men. A closer look deepens the picture. Our research identified occupation groups most at risk from generative AI by assigning exposure scores for 1,000 jobs currently being done by the US workforce. This score doesn’t reflect the percent of workers who will be out of a job or their chance of losing a job. Rather, it’s the percent of job tasks that will be automated or assisted by generative AI, weighted by the relative importance of those tasks. (While our research analyzed the US workforce, we believe the results can be confidently extrapolated worldwide.) Our analysis confirms that jobs historically performed by women are at high risk of displacement. For instance: With these numbers pointing to a disproportionate disadvantage for a substantial segment of the workforce, businesses need to take action to right the balance. It will be essential to safeguard women from bearing an unfair share of the disruptive impacts of generative AI. In our New work, new world report, we discuss the urgent need for a new trust compact that balances the negative impacts of generative AI on individuals and society with its considerable benefits. Clearly, this trust compact is particularly vital for women. Here are some key ways businesses can provide women with equitable access to opportunity and economic mobility in the generative AI era. As generative AI moves into the mainstream, this powerful technology could distribute productivity gains across social sectors and act as a balance wheel for society. Businesses have an opportunity to help fulfill that promise. By preparing now, businesses can ensure women—and other underrepresented workers with diverse backgrounds—have a seat at the table when generative AI is implemented. For if gen AI is to achieve its lofty goals, no one can be knowingly left behind by this world-changing technology. To learn more, visit the Generative AI section of our website.

October 27, 2023 By changing their approach to clinical development with generative AI, life sciences companies can realize exponential revenue opportunities and offer renewed hope to patients. When it comes to clinical development, saving time translates to saving lives, or at least improving them, through faster availability of treatments. For life sciences companies, it also translates into revenue opportunity—and a significant one at that. Some industry sources estimate that delivering new treatments to market ahead of schedule can be worth anywhere from $600,000 to $8 million per day. The promise of speed is why generative AI is so compelling for life sciences companies. Generative AI helps automate standard development processes, find patterns, identify insights and produce relevant, meaningful content in any number of formats, all in a fraction of the time it would take for a human to do so. We’ve identified four key areas of the clinical development lifecycle that can be accelerated and enhanced through the use of generative AI and supporting technologies. For life sciences companies that adopt gen AI, clinical development efficiency gains will be measured not in days or weeks but in months or even years—representing both an exponential revenue opportunity and renewed hope for patients. #1: Streamline research processes using semantic search. Generative AI could fundamentally change the clinical and scientific research process. Instead of beginning with a manual keyword search and sifting through hundreds of articles across various sources, research teams could prompt a generative AI-enabled tool to rapidly search, gather and distill relevant articles or even suggest unanticipated information pathways to explore. This frees researchers to focus on analysis. In our client engagements, we’ve seen 10X time savings when life sciences companies have applied generative AI to the research process. Generative AI could also change how research is conducted. Because the underlying models understand intent and context, these tools can work from a mission- or goal-based prompt, as opposed to relying on traditional keyword searches. For example, if a company is developing a cholesterol medication, a traditional process might begin with keyword searches involving different combinations of terms like ""cholesterol,"" ""clinical trial,” ""efficacy,"" ""safety,"" ""hyperlipidemia"" and ""statins,"" ultimately uncovering disparate results across different source platforms. However, with an AI-enabled tool, researchers could state their goal and receive contextualized reference materials to support that specific concept. “I'm designing a clinical trial for a new cholesterol medication,” a researcher might state to a generative AI tool. “Please provide an overview of the most recent studies on cholesterol medications, their efficacy and safety, and how they compare with existing treatments. Also, any insights on best practices and regulations would be valuable."" Finally, generative AI can also be used to analyze and synthesize relevant research materials and present them in a digestible way to a variety of constituents, from team members across multiple departments, to regulatory agencies, to institutional and ethical review boards. Ideally, these summaries would include a high degree of explainability regarding why those materials were selected. This further expedites the review process, which can also unlock time savings. Explainability is the ability of the generative AI-enabled tool to document how it arrived at the conclusions presented in a given output and provide a rationale for any recommendations being proposed. For example, when authoring a clinical trial protocol, the tool may include references to past protocols in a government database with similar trial dynamics, as well as components from successful trials. This capability can help researchers and other team members quickly assess the output, view it within the proper context and identify the best next step in the process. #2: Automate the authoring of clinical trial protocols to improve efficiency and access. It can take a few months to over a year to author a clinical trial protocol document. But companies that leverage generative AI and large language models (LLMs) can dramatically reduce that time, to days or even hours. A foundational model for research can be fed and trained on thousands of clinical trial protocols available online through government and industry databases and proprietary company research data. As such, generative AI-enabled tools can quickly scan thousands of entries within a given database and identify the patterns relevant to investigational products, certain conditions, specific patient populations or other factors. If the company has its own proprietary data, the tool can also incorporate that information into the foundational research model. As the tool identifies relevant patterns, it can design a baseline study, define the narrative, determine eligibility, draft exclusionary criteria and provide other details. The draft, or a group of draft options, can then be evaluated and refined by a human. It’s also possible to expedite the protocol review and approval cycles because the protocol could be summarized and accompanied by an explanation. We estimate that life sciences companies can shave 50% to 60% off the time spent writing protocols, while reducing related review cycles another 10% to 20%. 50%-60% estimated reduction in clinical trial authoring times. Life sciences companies can also use generative AI to design studies that leverage other digital capabilities or enable a non-traditional trial model, such as a decentralized, virtual or hybrid format. For example, during the authoring phase, the foundational model or LLM could leverage valid data from wearables, sensors or other means of collecting biomarkers outside of a traditional clinical trial site or clinical setting. When they have specific information about the technologies needed to enable such a trial, companies can consider a wider range of options, which may, in turn, allow them to recruit from a larger base of participants. In this way, generative AI isn’t just expediting the authoring process, but potentially designing a trial format that would speed recruitment, enrollment and testing. Beyond identifying eligible trial participants, generative AI could also analyze demographic and behavioral data to suggest population segments likely to use these tools and remain engaged throughout the study. One high-profile example of how generative AI is being used within the medical research community is AlphaFold. This AI program, developed by Google DeepMind, leverages deep learning to perform predictions of protein structures based on its string of amino acids. With this technology, what once took years of research can now be reduced to minutes. #3: Identify areas for improvement through next-gen clinical study reports. It’s very time-consuming to analyze clinical trial data and summarize it in a way that demonstrates statistical significance, while also maintaining safety and efficacy standards. It’s also prone to error when done manually. For years, conventional AI has been used to accelerate this compilation of data through prediction and probability. However, generative AI can reveal new connections not immediately apparent to human researchers or conventional models. For example, traditional AI may be able to extract a key statistic, such as trial recruitment velocity. However, with generative AI, the model could explain the reason behind that number and also offer recommendations for improvement. The additional context and recommendations could include: One of the major value drivers of generative AI is that this information is all conveyed in an easy-to-understand format. No longer would research teams need to review several pages of Excel-based data or perform manual calculations to see how changes in the strategy may affect outcomes. Nor would they need to cross-reference data with social media plans or ad buys. Instead, the tool takes all that information and consolidates it into a clear list of recommended actions. Yseop, an AI software company working with enterprises in highly regulated industries, developed Yseop Copilot, a secure content automation solution. Yseop Copilot leverages pre-trained LLM models for the biopharma industry to automate scientific content creation, helping medical writers across hundreds of clinical trials to significantly cut writing times. #4: Expedite the treatment launch process. Once approval for a new therapy is secured in a primary market, a tremendous amount of work goes into launching the drug in a secondary market. This includes strategy development, market research, contracting, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) negotiations, agency engagement, content creation and material development. As with the research and protocol writing processes, much of this activity could be automated through generative AI. And, as noted above, gen AI-enabled tools can also provide recommended actions to improve outcomes or further accelerate the process. We estimate that companies could generate another 10X time savings, compared with traditional processes, through the use of gen AI in this area. For example, when a drug is close to gaining approval, generative AI can help commercial teams research and compile baseline strategy documents for secondary markets, taking into account any specific regulations that need to be adhered to. In addition, generative AI-enabled tools can be used to translate existing materials, such as ads, websites, brochures or other sales materials, so that these assets reflect the local language and culture. Using the technology in this way could shed an additional year from the go-to-market timeline and dramatically reduce costs related to content creation and design across various markets. While generative AI will undoubtedly play a role in the future of the life sciences industry, factors such as an uncertain regulatory landscape, coupled with the rapidly evolving nature of generative AI itself, are prompting some companies to delay investment until the course ahead is clearer. However, those who take a strategic approach at this early juncture and build maturity will likely find themselves with a strong competitive advantage as the rest of the industry plays catchup. With that in mind, here are six recommendations for building generative AI maturity today: Most of the use cases explored here are relatively straightforward, both in terms of their practicality and low barriers to deployment. They represent a low-risk, high-reward value proposition. However, far more advanced use cases represent the next generation of this technology, such as using generative AI-enabled telehealth tools for patient companion apps. These applications, which would mimic a traditional caregiver experience and provide one-on-one patient support, present a tremendous opportunity to improve access to care, while also addressing significant shortages of healthcare professionals. As life sciences companies experiment with generative AI, they will begin to lay the foundation needed to harness its full potential for both their own business and the people they serve.

October 03, 2024 Nordic businesses are poised for generative AI adoption, with projected spending surpassing the global average. However, challenges related to talent acquisition, technological infrastructure, regulatory complexity and the adaptation of existing business models may stall ambitious rollout plans. Nordic businesses are keeping pace with global generative AI investment trends, with average projected spending reaching $49.7 million per company this year, according to our recent research, slightly above the global average of $47 million. These investments are taking place amid a sense of urgency to realize the potential of this powerful technology, with 65% of businesses expressing a desire to accelerate their generative AI strategies. At the same time, about two-thirds (62%) of Nordic businesses express at least moderate worry about the existential impact of generative AI on their operations. This measured perspective is perhaps characteristic of a region known for its thoughtful approach to pursuing technological advancement within the context of its potential societal and ethical implications, as seen in its early investment into sustainability. To better understand what generative AI adoption will look like globally, we conducted a study of 2,200 business leaders in 23 countries and 15 industries, including 110 in the Nordics. The study assessed a wide range of generative AI adoption trends, including investment levels, use cases, how critical gen AI strategies are to business success, and organizational readiness to adopt the technology. We also analyzed 18 regional and internal business factors that will either inhibit or accelerate business adoption of gen AI (see the end of the report for the full list of factors). Respondents evaluated each factor’s potential impact on their generative AI strategy, rating it as either positive or negative on a scale of high to low impact. From the results, we calculated a “momentum score” for each country or region. The momentum score represents the level of confidence business leaders have about being able to roll out their generative AI strategy based on internal business factors and the prevailing local conditions of their country or region. For all the regions covered, inhibitors to adoption outranked accelerators, meaning that all momentum scores skewed negative. In effect, businesses globally feel constrained by their operating environment. But to understand how different regions varied relative to each other, we averaged the ratings to establish a baseline global momentum score. This approach enabled us to identify regions that are more optimistic about their ability to adopt the technology compared with a global average. While there is clear investment in generative AI across the Nordic region, the overall momentum score of -14% indicates a more cautious approach compared with the global average. Several factors contribute to this measured pace, notably concerns surrounding consumer perceptions, the adaptability of existing business models, and the cost and availability of skilled talent. Additionally, challenges related to current technology infrastructure and the perceived maturity of generative AI technologies are contributing factors. However, Nordic businesses display a more optimistic outlook in key areas. They express greater confidence in their operating models' flexibility, market demand, the quality of generative AI outputs, data readiness and the availability of compute power. This suggests that companies will be able to leverage internal strengths to address specific challenges and accelerate their adoption of generative AI.

Figure 1 As for where businesses’ generative AI investments will be aimed in the near term, we looked at two distinct uses of the technology: productivity, such as helping people work more quickly and get more done, and disruptive innovation, which involves more sweeping change to business and operating models. Overall, businesses in the Nordics mirror the global trend: Over the next two years, more respondents expect to use generative AI to boost productivity than drive disruptive change (see Figure 2). However, our study also reveals a change in what productivity means when pursued with generative AI. The end goal is not efficiency and cost-cutting as has been the case with previous automation endeavors. This new dynamic requires fresh thinking around understanding business use cases of generative AI, which we’ll address later in this report. Notably, Nordic businesses are more likely than their global peers to embed generative AI into their products and services in the next two years (31% vs. the global average of 26%). This suggests a pervasive belief that generative AI will become an integral part of the Nordic business landscape and citizens’ digital lives.

Figure 2 This report identifies the regional and business factors that could either inhibit or accelerate generative AI momentum in the Nordics. It also provides an industry-specific look at how generative AI will be used, a regional focus on business readiness, and strategies for Nordic businesses to successfully implement generative AI. To dig deeper into these mechanics, rather than comparing to a global average, we’ll now examine how business leaders rate inhibitors and accelerators within their region. By doing so, our study provides a detailed temperature check on what respondents view as the main inhibitors and accelerators to generative AI in their region. With this assessment, leaders can take advantage of what’s working well in their local environment, while strategizing on overcoming challenges. A look at Nordic gen AI accelerators Respondents were asked which factors inhibit or accelerate their organization's adoption of generative AI. Score represents a percentage point difference to the country's momentum score compared to the global baseline.

Figure 3 The flexibility of operating models in Nordic companies serves as a strong foundation for generative AI adoption. Companies like Danish shipping and logistics giant Maersk, for example, have successfully integrated AI into their operations to track shipments, anticipate disruptions and proactively identify alternatives. Complementing this adaptability is a growing market demand for generative AI. AI tool usage is widespread in the Nordic region, with nearly half the population using these tools to some extent in 2024. This underscores the need to invest in and enhance the region's infrastructure to match changing behaviors and enhance safe and effective use. Data readiness further bolsters the region's prospects. In many ways, the Nordic region is leading the charge on data issues, especially as it relates to privacy. For example, Finland's ""MyData"" initiative, which enables people to own and control the use of their personal data, exemplifies the Nordics' commitment to data management, privacy and security, and provides a strong foundation for safer development and deployment of generative AI applications. At the same time, a significant portion (48%) of businesses believe their data security practices are not robust enough to support generative AI initiatives. This highlights the need for investment in modernizing infrastructure and strengthening security measures to ensure the responsible and safe deployment of AI technologies. Finally, the availability of compute power also plays a significant role. The presence of major data centers from global cloud providers and initiatives like the LUMI petascale supercomputer in Finland ensures that Nordic businesses have access to the computational resources necessary for generative AI development.

Figure 4 While the Nordics demonstrate a promising outlook on certain aspects of generative AI adoption, several challenges persist, dampening overall momentum in the region. Consumer perception tops the list of inhibitors to scaled adoption in the Nordics, which is understandable given the various ethical, regulatory and privacy concerns that surround the technology. While a majority of respondents (74%) say they are experimenting with customer-facing use cases of generative AI, 46% are not confident about their existing technology’s ability to support compliance with customer privacy regulations. This underscores the need for businesses in the region to build trust and transparency with the public. The global scarcity of AI talent is another pressing concern. While 30% of businesses plan to hire to fill knowledge gaps, our research indicates significant apprehension among companies regarding talent acquisition. This concern is likely exacerbated by the competitive talent market, particularly for high-demand roles, such as data scientists, data engineers and machine learning engineers. Relying solely on external hires may not be a sustainable long-term strategy, prompting 491% of businesses to rely on training programs for existing employees in generative AI and 26% to consider external partnerships to bridge skills gaps. The Nordic region is home to innovative initiatives such as AI Labs in Sweden, which aims to address both talent and infrastructure challenges. However, the persistent scarcity of AI talent underscores the urgency for businesses to develop comprehensive strategies that encompass both talent acquisition and development. Of course, there are many use cases and strategies for using generative AI. As we’ve said, Nordic businesses are primarily focused on realizing productivity gains with generative AI, at least in the next two years. However, a look at what’s driving their business cases sheds a new light on productivity from how it’s been seen historically. Traditionally, businesses have equated automation productivity gains with cost-cutting: driving down the cost of output by reducing the number of people needed to get work done. While generative AI-driven automation will likely lower headcount to some degree, that is no longer the end goal. Instead, as seen through the metrics respondents will use to drive business cases, we see a shift toward redirecting productivity gains into funding endeavors that increase revenues or lead to entirely new revenue streams. The metrics Nordic businesses say will be most important for justifying generative AI expenditures include increasing revenues, discovering new revenue sources and improved product and service quality, all of which were named by at least 44% of respondents (see Figure 5). Conversely, metrics like cost savings, time-to-market and productivity were cited by less than 30% of respondents. In other words, the concept of productivity no longer stops at cost-cutting—businesses appear to be redirecting productivity gains into initiatives aimed at growth. This emphasis on growth-oriented metrics also reflects the unique socioeconomic landscape of the Nordics, which discourages workforce reductions. Further, strong labor unions can make such measures costly, particularly for larger enterprises. Consequently, these businesses tend to favor strategies that empower them to achieve ""more with the same"" rather than pursuing the traditional ""same with less"" approach.

Figure 5 Using this more granular view of productivity goals and business drivers, we analyzed the differences in how industries intend to use the technology. Rather than focusing on the distinction between productivity vs. innovation, we grouped the metrics into two high-level categories of business use cases: We then assigned each of the metrics a score to see the relative gap between a number-one-ranking metric and a number-three-ranking metric. By calculating the average score across industries, we could clearly see how each industry’s responses deviated from the baseline. Our analysis reveals stark differences among Nordic industries in terms of the business use cases they’ll likely prioritize (see Figure 6). Industries diverge on business cases Note: This figure depicts each industry’s relative deviation from a baseline of “zero,” using a ranked scoring of the top-three metrics respondents cite as important for justifying their generative AI use cases. It reveals a weighted view of each industry’s overall priorities for gen AI deployment. Base: 110 senior business leaders in the Nordics

Figure 6 Retail and consumer goods: Retail giants like IKEA are harnessing the power of generative AI to reshape the customer journey. The retailer released an AI-powered design assistant, enabling customers to experiment with different furniture arrangements and styles using natural language prompts. This not only empowers customers to visualize their dream spaces, but also demonstrates IKEA's commitment to innovation and customer-centricity. Communications, media and technology: Spotify, the Swedish audio streaming powerhouse, exemplifies the Nordics' leadership in leveraging generative AI for innovation. Spotify's recently launched AI Playlist feature empowers users to create highly personalized playlists simply by typing in a descriptive prompt. Whether it's ""upbeat pop songs for a summer road trip"" or ""ambient music for coding,"" Spotify's generative AI translates these prompts into unique and tailored listening experiences, setting a new standard for music discovery and personalization. Healthcare: Nordic countries are known for their universal healthcare system, and generative AI is being seen as one way to increase efficiency and reduce costs while also improving care. In Finland, the Helsinki University Hospital is piloting an AI-powered medical transcription service that converts doctors' spoken notes into accurate and structured medical records. This significantly reduces administrative burden, enabling healthcare professionals to focus more time on patient care. Insurance: The insurance sector in the Nordics is leveraging generative AI to streamline processes and enhance customer experiences. For instance, the Danish insurance company Tryg is using AI-powered chatbots to handle customer inquiries and claims processing, resulting in faster response times and improved customer satisfaction. Generative AI is also being used to analyze vast amounts of data to identify fraud patterns and assess risk more accurately, leading to more efficient underwriting and claims management processes. A remaining question is whether businesses are ready to drive real value from these use cases. The answer, according to our research, is mixed. To better understand how prepared executives believe their business is to adopt generative AI, we asked respondents to rank their organization’s maturity on a scale of 1 to 4 by selecting a statement that best described their organization in the following five areas, from low maturity to high: The output reveals where business leaders believe they are already mature, and areas where they feel the need to evolve capabilities considerably to make generative AI investments work. Leadership support is sound, but fundamentals are lacking Respondents were asked to rate the maturity of their organization's operations in relation to generative AI. (Percent of respondents rating each as a 3 or 4, with 4 representing the highest level of maturity). Base: 110 senior business leaders in the Nordics
Source: Cognizant and Oxford Economics
Figure 7 Nordic respondents present a nuanced view of their readiness for generative AI. While the majority of respondents rated leadership commitment and strategy as mature or highly mature, foundational elements like technology infrastructure, skills and organizational agility need strengthening (see Figure 7). A particular area of concern is skills and talent as the skills gap could hamper the successful implementation and utilization of generative AI technologies. Moreover, the low ratings for technology and infrastructure highlights potential challenges in data management, processing capabilities and overall technological preparedness for the demands of generative AI. Nordic organizations also grapple with data accessibility issues. Although 52% believe their data is in good condition, a mere 22% rate their data accessibility as good or excellent. This discrepancy underscores the challenge of harnessing data effectively for generative AI applications, which demands not only clean data but also readily available information across business units and stakeholders. It is particularly worrying that 45% of Nordic respondents anticipate their compliance with generative AI government regulations will be either nonexistent or inadequate. This is especially concerning given the Nordic region's strong emphasis on regulation and social welfare. To fully capitalize on the potential of generative AI and overcome existing challenges, Nordic businesses should prioritize the following actions: *The full list of regional factors we evaluated includes: the flexibility of the existing operating model, market demand for gen AI-enabled products and services, data readiness, quality of output from gen AI, availability of compute power, cost/availability of gen AI-related technologies, shareholder/investor sentiment, regulatory environment, sustainability, national infrastructure, cost/availability of capital, data privacy and security, existing technology infrastructure, current and prospective employee perceptions, flexibility of the existing business model, maturity of gen AI-related technologies, consumer perceptions and cost/availability of talent.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. July 30, 2024 Our global study reveals high levels of generative AI spending and leadership commitment—but also an acute sense of moving too slowly. By understanding the biggest global challenges of generative AI momentum, businesses can realize the full potential of this powerful technology. Generative AI is widely viewed as critical to business success and is seeing significant investment from organizations around the world. In our recent study, more than 2000 global businesses across 15 countries say they’ll spend an average of $47.5 million on generative AI in their business in the current financial year, and nearly three-quarters (74%) say it’s important or very important to their continued success. However, there are some very real factors that could inhibit generative AI momentum, and businesses globally are already feeling the heat: Despite leadership support and ample funding, many already feel they’re moving too slowly with their generative AI strategies and that delays could hurt them competitively. There appears to be a marked gap between leadership’s strategic commitment to this new technology and business leaders’ confidence in their ability to execute on it. To gain a global perspective on generative AI adoption, we surveyed 2,200 business executives across 23 countries and 15 industries about their generative AI strategies, including inhibitors and accelerators to generative AI momentum, investment levels, use cases and organizational readiness to adopt the technology. The study builds on our previous “New Work, New World” report, which highlighted the potential economic gains and challenges generative AI could bring to the US economy. What we found is that while the majority of global businesses are seeking productivity gains with their generative AI use cases, the end goal is less about cost-cutting and more about fueling growth. Further, amid rampant enthusiasm for generative AI, inhibitors like talent acquisition, technological infrastructure and consumer perception threaten to stand in the way. By understanding the biggest barriers to generative AI momentum, however, businesses can overcome them and fully leverage the potential of generative AI. Not surprisingly, respondents in our study were more interested in the productivity gains of generative AI than using the technology to revamp business and operating models or drive disruptive innovation. At a global level, 44% of companies emphasized productivity as their greatest strategic priority vs. 36% pointing to innovation and 34% to redesigned operating models (see Figure 1). This aligns with a key promise of generative AI: to help people work more efficiently and get more done. Greater focus on productivity than innovation
Q: Which of the following best describes the role generative AI will play in your organization's business strategy in the next two years? (Percent of respondents naming each as a top 3 choice) Base: 2,200 senior business leaders

 Figure 1 What productivity means with generative AI, however, is different from what it’s historically meant with business automation. Traditionally, businesses have equated automation productivity gains with cost-cutting: driving down the cost of output by reducing the number of people needed to get work done. While generative AI-driven automation will likely lower headcount to some degree, that is no longer the end goal. Instead, our study points to a shift toward redirecting the savings gained through productivity to funding innovation or discovering entirely new revenue streams. Consider, for instance, that 76% of businesses plan to use generative AI to create new revenue streams, and 58% are using the prospect of increased revenue to justify their business cases. This shows a marked shift in leadership thinking about productivity and automation, and it clarifies why businesses are so sure the technology is critical to their success going forward. At the same time, most respondents (70%) believe their organization is not moving fast enough to keep pace with industry peers, and a large majority (82%) feel these delays could place them at a competitive disadvantage. On average, respondents believe it will take four to five years to see significant impact from generative AI. But with only 26% of respondents saying they’d implemented cross-enterprise use cases of generative AI to date, there is still a lot of room for scaling and maturing these implementations. To understand what will constrain or encourage adoption, we compiled a list of 18 regional and internal business factors that could either inhibit or accelerate business adoption of gen AI. We asked respondents to evaluate each factor’s potential impact on their generative AI strategy, rating it as either positive or negative on a scale of high to low impact. Globally, the top three inhibitors are: 1) Cost and availability of talent. Talent scarcity is truly a global issue. Given that the technology requires deep expertise in fields such as machine learning, data science and neural networks, the demand for such talent far exceeds the current supply. This talent gap not only threatens to slow down the development and deployment of AI solutions, but it also drives up the costs associated with hiring and retaining qualified personnel—a fact lamented by respondents in our survey. While 54% are investing in training and development programs to build the necessary expertise in-house, 37% plan to hire externally—with no clear idea of where that talent could be found (see Figure 2). Many will reskill, while others hold out hope for hiring

 Figure 2 2) Consumer perceptions. Many consumers harbor concerns about privacy, security and the ethical use of AI-generated content. Our recent survey on consumer trust reveals that just one-third of US consumers trust generative AI. Mistrust stems from three key concerns: economic security, uncertainty about how the technology works and fear of its societal impacts. Shoring up consumer trust is essential to optimizing generative AI strategies. 3) Perceived immaturity of current generative AI solutions. Despite impressive advancements, many AI models still struggle with reliability, accuracy and scalability. Current generative systems can produce outputs that are impressive in certain contexts but fall short in others, often requiring human oversight to ensure quality and relevance. Moreover, integrating these solutions into existing business processes can be complex and resource-intensive. The path to maturity involves extensive research and development, as well as best practices for deployment and integration. The challenge ahead is to take full advantage of the factors that could encourage gen AI strategy success, while overcoming the inhibitors. Here are three actions businesses can take to see real returns from generative AI adoption. There’s no doubt businesses globally are enthusiastic about pursuing generative AI initiatives. But they also know what’s at stake and that the clock is ticking. To make the best decisions moving forward, businesses need a clear view on what could drive or constrain the success of their generative AI strategies. In our upcoming reports, we'll reveal what's happening with generative AI momentum in 13 countries and regions around the world. In these reports, business leaders will learn: Crucially, we also outline the strategic moves business leaders can make to capitalize on the accelerators and bypass the inhibitors to ensure they reap the full rewards of AI: a driving force of business success in the future.

The agentic enterprise emerges For the past two years, the question of how to best use artificial intelligence (AI) has dominated business agendas. At most organizations, the work has been largely internal. Leaders have focused on boosting efficiency, preparing the workforce for new ways of working and integrating the technology into their operations—in effect, activities that businesses can directly control. This internal work has been worth the effort: In 2024, we predicted it would drive up to $1 trillion in GDP due to productivity gains by 2032 in the US alone. Yet, outside the boardroom, a more powerful and potentially multitrillion-dollar force has been gaining momentum: consumers experimenting with AI—with huge implications for business. Already, people are searching for products using conversational AI and even placing orders with their voice assistants. Based on our newest research study, which is focused on consumer use of AI, these seemingly inconsequential activities will soon transform the consumer journey: how people discover, purchase and engage with the products and experiences they buy. This customer-led movement cannot be ignored. By 2030, AI-friendly consumers will be responsible for up to 55% of consumer purchasing activity. Driving this massive uptick is a small but fast-growing segment of consumers our research has identified as AI Accelerators. This group not only embraces AI-enabled tools but also represents the future of purchasing. Accelerators make up just 25% of consumers today, but as their income and spending power increases, they will become an increasingly influential market force. in the US in the UK in Germany in Australia At the same time, consumer comfort with AI is not universal, nor is it consistent across the three key phases of the customer journey: when customers are learning about new products, buying them and using them. Many people still approach AI with caution, understanding the convenience and time savings it offers but remaining reluctant to cede control of the process, especially at critical moments, such as when clicking “buy.” These mixed attitudes will drive three distinct waves of market change over the next five years, culminating in 2030 when AI will be fully embedded in the purchase journey. It will be vital for organizations to understand the nuances of what consumers want to do with AI (and what they don’t or won’t) and how their behaviors will develop. Businesses will also have to understand and prepare for what comes next in the AI journey: the agentic internet, an interconnected ecosystem of AI-enabled tools and agents working on behalf of consumers to autonomously locate, evaluate, purchase and maintain the products and services they rely on. With the agentic internet, consumers will gain what amounts to a personal digital concierge that works with business AI agents to orchestrate complex tasks across the purchase journey. Businesses that adapt to this new reality will thrive, but the challenges are formidable. There are serious considerations to keep in mind such as: These questions must guide decision-making not just for consumer-facing businesses but also for any company that produces and sells a product or service in the AI-driven economy. Our research, conducted with Oxford Economics, explores these dynamics and issues using insights from over 8,400 survey respondents across four countries. The work was supplemented with extensive economic modeling and in-depth discussions with 80 consumers conducted by Cognizant Research. The findings are clear: AI will reshape the consumer journey across its three pivotal phases—Learn, Buy and Use—with each presenting distinct challenges and opportunities. This report is your guide to navigating the transformation, staying ahead of the adoption curve and anticipating the wants, needs and deal-breakers for a new class of AI-empowered customers. To understand how AI will change consumer behaviors and its long-term economic impact, we needed to segment consumers into demographic groups based on their overall likelihood to use AI. To do this, we created the AI Intensity Index, applying insights from an analysis of historic patterns of consumer technology adoption to AI sentiment responses from our survey. (See methodology for details on the creation of our AI Intensity Index.) The higher on the AI Intensity Index someone scores, the more likely they are to use AI during their purchasing journey. The lower their score is in the index, the more likely they are to eschew AI when researching and purchasing products and services. Using this analysis, we identified three pivotal groups that represent the highest and lowest levels of AI intensity: Accelerators, Early Adopters and Anchors. A fourth group, Agnostics, represents people who have no strong feelings about AI and, as such, are unlikely to move the needle in either direction (see Figure 1). Figure 1  
Our analysis uncovered demographic details that are statistically most likely to be associated with each of these groups. The characteristics are independent of each other, and do not necessarily apply to each consumer in the groups.

Source: Cognizant and Oxford Economics As Accelerator and Early Adopter purchasing power grows, both groups will become agents of transformation across industries. However, Anchors will continue to be an important consumer group for businesses to retain and serve. Meanwhile, our research also reveals insights that are true across all four consumer cohorts. These findings are important for businesses to consider as they determine the best way forward for interacting with consumers using AI: Convenience drives adoption
For all consumers, convenience is the strongest driver of AI adoption. Frustration with the buying process, a problem noted by 75% of all respondents, will push consumers toward AI solutions that save them time. In fact, 22% of consumers cited time savings as their top reason for using AI compared with just 12% who see it as a way to find the best deal. Control is critical
Even with their desire for convenience, consumers require a sense of control, especially when it comes to finalizing the purchase selection and transaction. A striking 75% say they are unlikely to allow AI to automatically reorder and pay for high-value items without their direct authorization. Familiarity breeds trust
Our research suggests that incorporating AI into familiar devices and user experiences such as smartphones and apps could encourage AI adoption across cohorts. Consumers have already become comfortable with a wide range of sensitive and relatively risky activities on their mobile devices, including banking services (which 52% of respondents are comfortable doing) and booking travel (44%). The same dynamic could unfold with AI. As it integrates seamlessly into familiar devices and consumers gain more exposure to AI-powered tools, their distrust and fear may diminish, too, making them increasingly receptive over time. To understand consumer behaviors at a more granular level, we also studied AI use at each phase of the customer journey. This journey—how consumers discover, purchase and engage with products and services before and after a sale—is at the heart of the business-customer relationship. We separated consumer touchpoints into three buckets, which we’ve dubbed Learn, Buy and Use. Next, we calculated a Comfort Quotient, using qualitative and quantitative data to rate consumers' level of comfort using AI at each touchpoint on a scale of zero to 100. The higher the score, the higher the comfort with AI use.¹ Our Comfort Quotient reveals uneven consumer acceptance of AI across the purchase journey (see Figure 2). A composite score of consumers' comfort with using an array of AI tools across the three stages of the purchase journey and 36 products and services in 15 industries, based on survey data and in-depth consumer interviews. Higher number = more comfortable Lower number = less comfortable Consumers are most comfortable in the Learn phase, followed by Use and Buy. This discovery phase is where consumers feel most comfortable with AI-enabled tools, achieving an average Comfort Quotient of 47. As such, Learn is the first and most critical phase for businesses to focus on. However, there are vast differences among cohorts. Early Adopters and Accelerators have much higher scores of 58 and 50, respectively, while Anchors have a score of 33. “I love the idea of AI helping me choose products and services because you can make the process faster, more efficient, and even enjoyable.” Amrita, 26, Australia This decision-making phase is where we saw the most hesitation from consumers. The average Comfort Quotient for the Buy phase is just 27. Even Early Adopters show an overall reluctance to use AI to execute on purchases, with a comparatively low score of 34. Anchors are particularly hesitant, with a score of just 16. ""I hate the idea of AI helping me make purchases because I like to know what and when I’m buying, and what payment method I use.” Eugene, 36, US Consumer comfort with AI rebounds in the post-sale engagement phase, reaching a Comfort Quotient of 39. This score is buoyed predominantly by an eager Early Adopter cohort, with a quotient of 47, but also by a surprisingly strong showing by Anchors. With a score of 34, Use turns out to be where Anchors are most comfortable using AI. “I love that AI can optimize my experience by helping me get the most value from a product or service without needing to read a manual or set of instructions or search for tutorials online.” Idris, 25, UK Figure 2

Source: Cognizant Research analysis of data collected by Oxford Economics and YouGov The Learn phase is where consumers form their first impressions of a brand. However, it’s also a common area of consumer frustration given the overwhelming number of options that traditional search mechanisms yield. This makes Learn a low-hanging fruit for AI improvement. Rather than a laundry list of search results, AI discovery can curate a shortlist of options. When combined with consumers’ high comfort levels, the Learn phase represents a prime opportunity for businesses to capture attention and influence decisions. Doing so starts with understanding what consumers value about using AI in this phase and the AI tools they’re most comfortable using. Frustration with traditional search sparks a desire for convenience Consumers don’t always trust what’s behind AI search results Different consumers want different approaches to discovery Frustration with traditional search leads to a desire for convenience Convenience matters at this stage as saving time is the top reason consumers cite for using AI in the Learn phase. In a crowded market, consumers are keen to find what they’re looking for swiftly—whether that’s asking a voice assistant to suggest options based on their personal data or using visual search to identify a brand or product they screenshot on social media. AI-enabled tools that deliver on consumer desires for a shorter, streamlined discovery process—such as voice assistants, conversational AI, personalized recommendations and visual search—ranked highest in consumer comfort levels (see Figure 3). Here, AI functions as an assistant, curating options and streamlining the discovery process. In our qualitative research, consumers praised tools such as conversational AI for simplifying complex searches (“It’s a great tool to find and understand something complex with little exploration”) and visual search for speed (“It makes it convenient to find specific products I don’t know the name of”). Consumers don’t always trust what’s behind AI search results But there’s another side to this coin: Amid their quest for convenience, even Accelerators and Early Adopters stress the need for privacy, trust and transparency. Dynamic pricing and targeted ads, for example, earned low comfort ratings due to perceptions of the potential for manipulation and profiteering. “It is scary to think that every single thing I search for is being stored … and being used to create targeted digital advertising,” one respondent said. Personalized recommendations, while praised for their relevance, leave little room for error; irrelevant suggestions can quickly erode trust. Consumers also question the true motivations of AI—is it really making the best choice for them, or is it pushing them to patronize a company’s partners or more lucrative vendors? Across all consumer groups, one of the most commonly cited concerns is that AI isn’t working in their best interests, with 13% of consumers rating it as their main worry.² Figure 3

Source: Cognizant and Oxford Economics Unsurprisingly, consumer sentiments vary. For example, one-third (34%) of Anchors say they wouldn’t use any AI-driven tools in the Learn phase. For these consumers, a preference for human interaction and distrust in the technology’s accuracy dominates. For example, nearly one in five—18%—say they wouldn’t use conversational AI because they prefer human contact. Another 17% worry that results will be incomplete or inaccurate. However, visual search emerged as a surprising bridge, with just a two percentage-point gap between Accelerators’ and Anchors’ comfort levels. This suggests that tools mimicking traditional search methods, even if enhanced by AI, may resonate with skeptical consumers. And tools with a clear value proposition—such as the ability to identify products from an image—will help even the most reluctant consumers adopt AI over time. As one consumer explained, “Visual search can help you find the precise product you've been looking for without having to guess keywords and spend time browsing many sites to try and find the product you want.” Business implication A new front in the battle for mindshare has been opened, and the old ways of getting on consumers’ radars are becoming obsolete. To avoid getting sidelined, businesses will need to orchestrate an operating model that ensures their products, services and experiences are surfaced by consumers using AI-driven tools while also remaining open to traditional avenues of product discovery, at least in the short term. The act of clicking “buy” or signing a digital contract is where confidence in AI falters. Despite the promise of convenience, consumers hesitate at this critical decision-making moment, unwilling to cross the significant psychological threshold between learning and buying. The reason: a reluctance to give up control. Consumers fear giving up control Comfort levels plummet, even for popular AI tools Interest is high, though, in a seamless buying experience Consumers fear giving up control Consumers fear the repercussions of yielding control to AI and allowing it to make purchases on their behalf. They're concerned, for instance, that AI might make incorrect or expensive decisions that are difficult to correct or undo, such as ordering more items than desired. Even consumers who are comfortable with AI automatically selecting which coffee brand to order, for instance, would still want to be in charge of the seemingly trivial action of clicking “buy.” In our qualitative interviews, consumers voiced such fears, with mentions of errors and inaccuracy coming up frequently. ""Voice assistants often misunderstand commands. They don't have a screen for me to validate that I've done the correct thing,"" one respondent complained. Data security is another concern. “I don’t know if I feel comfortable letting AI use my information and storing it to make payments easier,” another said. Distrust of what motivates AI decisions is also prevalent. ""I have a feeling that the algorithm will follow instructions from the highest bidder and not handle the purchase in my interest,” said one consumer. Comfort levels plummet, even for popular AI tools Even AI’s most enthusiastic users are wary of relinquishing decision-making power during the Buy phase. Compared with the Learn phase, Comfort Quotients for Accelerators and Early Adopters drop from 50 to 33 for the former and from 58 to 34 for the latter. More specifically, while 41% of Accelerators (and 52% of Early Adopters) are comfortable using conversational AI during the Learn phase, comfort with AI drops to just 33% and 46%, respectively, in the Buy phase (see Figure 4). A similar dynamic is true of voice assistants, which drops from 38% for Accelerators and 53% for Early Adopters for learning to 30% and 42%, respectively, when it comes to buying. Interestingly, technologies that add security verifications such as facial recognition compete closely with other technologies, especially among Anchors, in the buying stage. One consumer called it “an extra layer of verification and protection.” Figure 4

Source: Cognizant and Oxford Economics If anything could drive AI adoption in the Buy phase, it’s the desire for a smoother, efficient experience, especially for younger consumers. Among respondents who favor conversational AI in the Buy phase, over one-quarter cite time savings (27%) or enhanced experience (21%) as their primary motivator for using the tool. As one consumer said, “I totally enjoy using conversational AI when it comes to decisions regarding purchasing a product because it can navigate more complications and provide more personalized recommendations.” For businesses, this demonstrates how effective an AI tool could be in helping to navigate roadblocks such as complex questions, last-minute order adjustments and checkout errors. Removing inconveniences and frustration would serve as a key motivator for consumers to make the leap to an AI-enabled transaction. Business implication Consumers are adamant about maintaining control during the Buy stage. While it is possible their reticence may evolve over time as confidence in the security and objectives of AI solutions increases, such distrust currently poses a challenge. Businesses will need to strike a balance between automation and ceding some control to customers. The Use phase is where consumers interact with AI-embedded features in their products, services and experiences, from smart appliances to streaming services. This includes automated approaches to maintenance, servicing, reordering and upgrading features. In this way, AI becomes instrumental in extending the business-consumer relationship after the sale. We see a sharp rise in the Comfort Quotient for all consumers in the Use phase, including AI-skeptical Anchors, who—based on our analysis—are even more comfortable with using AI here than in the Learn phase. Consumers, it seems, appreciate the extreme convenience of automated engagement with their products and services. Consumers like the idea of products and services taking care of themselves However, they draw a line at automatic repurchasing Conversational AI and visual search are standouts for fast, reliable post-sales engagement Consumers like the idea of products and services taking care of themselves Consumers—perpetually looking to save time—are drawn to the idea of AI automating the upkeep, resupply, updating and enrichment of the products and services they use. Having AI involved at this stage often translates to touchless experiences. In the real world, this could be a refrigerator that restocks commonly used items without supervision, a car adding a personalized feature to save on fuel or a home heating system that senses an error code and emails it to the manufacturer for a specialized fix. In each example, the consumer experiences significant time savings as well as less aggravation. As one consumer pointed out, “I love the idea of AI helping me use products and services because I can do other things with the time it saves me.” For consumers, it will feel like AI is an invisible background force simplifying their lives. As one respondent put it, “AI doesn’t even need to be mentioned … it just is.” But they draw a line at automatic repurchasing Despite the higher comfort levels in the Use phase, resistance to fully automated post-sale purchases remains. As in the Buy phase, the desire for control kicks in again, with consumers expressing concern that AI won’t act in their best interest, such as reordering supplies at a premium simply to boost revenues instead of serving their needs. One consumer acknowledged that “while the convenience of AI repurchasing products and services is appealing, I have concerns about privacy and control over my purchases. Could it misinterpret my needs and send unwanted products?” While Accelerators were most likely to be comfortable with automated reorders and payments, their comfort levels decline as prices increase. For instance, 43% of Accelerators are comfortable with AI reordering low-priced items ($25), compared with 36% who are comfortable with reordering medium-priced ($100) items. Only about one-third (32%) felt comfortable with high-priced reorders ($500). Among all consumers, the Comfort Quotient drops to 28%, 22% and 18%, respectively, across the respective price tiers.

Source: Cognizant and Oxford Economics Conversational AI once again ranks as the most popular tool among Early Adopters and Accelerators but is one of the least popular for Anchors (see Figure 5). Conversational AI-driven capabilities such as real-time troubleshooting, personalized assistance with product usage issues and curated recommendations for product and service add-ons clearly appeal to AI-enthusiastic consumers. As one consumer said about this type of post-sales support, “I feel like I’d get the most value from a product or service without needing to read a manual or search for tutorials online. It’s less confusing to go through it step-by-step if I need to ask any questions.” That said, Anchors report similar comfort levels to Accelerators when using visual search in the Use phase, indicating a rare alignment between these otherwise distinct cohorts. Features like troubleshooting issues by submitting an image can help eliminate the frustration of having to articulate product issues into words—providing the speed Accelerators value and the clear, dependable support to build loyalty among Anchors. Business implication The higher Comfort Quotients in the Use phase are indicative of consumers’ willingness to engage far beyond the sale. This signals an opportunity for businesses to build customer relationships while also driving familiarity with the use of AI tools, which will encourage further adoption. The Use phase could also introduce new revenue streams both in aftermarket services and automated reordering. But these mechanisms could also prove disruptive for intermediaries. New original equipment manufacturer (OEM)-to-consumer channels will take business from traditional retailers, and those companies that lack partnerships with smart product manufacturers will be at risk of missing out. Based on all of these dynamics, we see dramatic market change ahead, characterized by three distinct periods of change between now and 2030. We’ve mapped out a timeline of how these changes will unfold, using our analysis of consumer groups, their AI adoption potential and, through analysis from Oxford Economics, their spending power, in addition to our own understanding of how—and how quickly—AI technologies and ecosystems will develop and mature. * Accelerators will see their consumption levels increase from $4.1 trillion to over $4.4 trillion in the US alone by 2030.

Figure 6
Source: Cognizant Research with economic data provided by Oxford Economics The first wave has already begun, as consumers are currently using AI to discover products, services and experiences. It has become commonplace to ask Alexa for the latest must-read novel or prompt ChatGPT to recommend the best restaurants in town. This rapid change is driven by Early Adopters and hastened by the larger group of Accelerators, whose economic impact will increase exponentially as more of them reach peak earning potential. The sheer volume of product options today, many with minute variations, has made traditional search increasingly ineffective. This will almost certainly continue to push consumers to offsite research, using generative AI to get conversational responses tailored to their needs. As one respondent observed, AI-augmented search “talks back to us and understands our weird descriptions yet finds us what we need.” This rapid change will only speed up, spurred by the self-reinforcing dynamic between Accelerators and tech giants. Accelerators are keen to use AI to streamline their discovery of products and services, and leading tech companies are embedding these capabilities into their consumer-facing tools. The outsized influence of tech giants on consumer adoption of technology has left businesses with limited control to slow or redirect the momentum. During this time period, we’ll see a rapid transformation of how customers discover products, marked by fierce competition by businesses to create both business-side agents and agent-friendly storefronts. To become the go-to destination for AI-driven customers, business will need to go beyond basic AI discoverability, to developing proprietary agents that broadcast the best offers and deals based on customer preferences. During this timeframe, users will become more comfortable using AI to engage with products and services after the sale. Consumers will begin to readily use AI-powered health assistants that recommend stretches for back pain, for instance, or smart appliances that proactively reorder parts or schedule maintenance before issues arise. Accelerators will remain the driving force of economic change during this time period, buoyed by Anchors, whose Comfort Quotient is highest in the Use phase. This creates added pressure for companies to participate in the markets driven by the growing wealth of Accelerators and the continued spending by Anchors. Responding to market change, however, requires significant work from businesses—more so than in Wave 1. Real transformation will require new business models and technology investments. AI features must be engineered into products, services and experiences. And for cars to autonomously schedule maintenance services and order supplies, or for healthcare devices to arrange medical appointments based on biological data, businesses will need significant reengineering and modernizing of existing technological infrastructure. The good news is that the AI-enabled after-sales market represents one of the most significant revenue opportunities of the future. OEMs have long sought more secure after-sales revenue streams and have developed subscription-based features for everything from tractor software updates to car seat warming. Now, entirely new businesses will emerge to manage and broker the data necessary to enable that smooth flow of commerce between humans, AI agents and connected devices. This nascent market buys businesses some time, but the window is narrow. These dynamics could result in the development of winner-takes-most competitions, with first movers potentially creating closed economies around their product, locking in loyal users and dominating the market. At this point, resistance to AI-driven purchasing will diminish, including in the Buy phase. Coming out of Wave 2, where after-sales repurchasing became commonplace, consumer comfort with AI tools across all three phases of the purchase journey will rise. This will pave the way for a significant transformation in how products and services are acquired and used. Accelerators will have established themselves as the dominant economic force, adding an estimated $300 billion in consumption in the US by 2030. Meanwhile, the Anchor cohort, who was adamantly against AI in the buying process, will slowly lose economic power. In the US alone, with their peak earning years behind them, this group will see their consumption shrink by $381 billion by 2030. With the overwhelming influence of Accelerators, AI will create increasingly automated purchase cycles. As this happens, the human role in buying decisions will diminish, and consumer willingness to cede control to AI will increase. Historical parallels, such as the adoption of e-commerce, mobile phones and social media, show how resistance gives way to widespread trust as technologies become deeply embedded in daily life. That said, it's likely industries will face different pressures at all stages, which could extend or tighten this timeframe. Businesses will need to adapt to this landscape where automated purchasing is no longer optional but a foundational element of modern commerce. As these three waves unfold, consumer AI agents will proliferate. Over time, the internet as we know it will transform. We’ll see a marked shift from buying being facilitated by manual searches and interactions with websites and apps to a fully agentic internet, where intelligent consumer agents work with business AI agents to orchestrate complex tasks across the purchase journey. With these networked interactions, users will soon engage primarily with their AI agents rather than directly with the business itself. This might sound futuristic, but younger consumers (Early Adopters and Accelerators) are already comfortable using AI tools such as voice assistants, conversational AI and visual search. The agentic internet will simply bring these increasingly familiar elements together into a cohesive whole, making it possible to automate the full spectrum of online purchasing tasks. Once AI agents become pervasive in everyday devices such as mobile devices, smart appliances and wearables, they will become a natural extension of consumers’ daily lives. The use of AI in familiar environments will encourage increased adoption over time. As this model develops, it could significantly alter the way consumers discover, compare, purchase and use products. Once agents get to know the consumer’s preferences, for instance, businesses might find it difficult to find a way onto the shortlist of options. Businesses would have to change their operating models to work with ecosystem partners, embrace new marketing methods to be visible to AI agents and update their supply operations to support a more agentic approach to purchasing. The rise of agent-driven interactions will also require dynamic, adaptable systems and processes capable of managing agent autonomy at scale, as well as flexible technology stacks and new business models aligned with the rise of personalized, agent-led transactions. A bed buying journey A consumer needs a new bed. Their AI agent is equipped with detailed information, including their age, weight, sleeping patterns and family/household makeup, gathered both directly from the consumer and autonomously through online activity and biometric monitoring. Using this information, the AI agent queries suppliers, evaluates options and provides a shortlist of suitable choices for the buyer to look at. Once a selection is made, the AI agent finalizes the transaction, arranges delivery with a business-side logistics agent and schedules a drop-off time for when it knows the consumer is typically home. During assembly, the consumer uses visual search to verify they have all the required components and understand where each piece fits. If the AI agent sees that there’s a missing bed slat or fastener, it quickly contacts the supplier’s support agent, arranges for replacement parts to be delivered and may even negotiate a partial refund on behalf of the consumer.

Source: Cognizant Research analysis These are your new consumers: People empowered by AI agents that autonomously manage interactions, transactions and decisions on their behalf. To thrive in the AI-driven consumer era ahead, businesses will need to rethink how they operate across six important areas: strategy, technology, design, architecture, operations and ethics. Leaders can get a head start by heeding these recommendations: At the Learn phase, consumers gravitate toward AI tools that reduce choice overload frustration. Capturing their attention at this critical junction will require new rules of engagement. For instance, as AI-powered tools such as voice assistants, visual search and conversational AI are increasingly used to research and discover products, businesses will have to take a multimodal approach to conveying their product and service information. Product descriptions will need to be both concise and easily understood when read aloud by a voice assistant or relayed via a conversational AI tool, while also incorporating high-quality images and videos optimized for visual search. Once businesses have made themselves known in the discovery phase, it’s time to move to the Use phase, where the consumer Comfort Quotient is also high. Doing so extends the customer relationship to after the sale, giving businesses the opportunity to fortify trust through continued AI-driven engagement with the product or service. Businesses can then build on that trust to move into the Buy phase, encouraging consumer confidence in using AI to automate purchases but with a sense of user control. By extending the positive experience of AI-assisted learning to encompass product usage and the purchase transaction itself, businesses can create a cohesive customer journey fit for the AI age. Extend the positive experience of AI-assisted learning to product usage and the purchase transaction itself to create a cohesive customer journey. The most important AI project your company will need to undertake may not be implementing AI internally but ensuring your products and services are discoverable on AI-driven platforms. As consumer AI agents become commonplace, businesses must have AI agents ready to interoperate with their consumer counterparts. This will require new infrastructure and data capabilities. This necessitates a deep understanding of how AI is being used within consumer platforms, and how your product offerings can be embedded within those environments. Simply creating an in-house solution, no matter how robust, will be insufficient if it doesn't interact with platforms where consumers are already engaging with AI. To make offerings AI-discoverable, businesses should consider partnering with leading AI providers to promote products and services during AI-powered discovery and collaborate on features that ensure visibility in high-value environments. This level of integration requires businesses to create APIs that integrate with external AI platforms and exchange data with consumer AI agents. Simultaneously, infrastructure investments will be needed to handle the increased data demands of interacting with these agents and platforms. Businesses also need to understand the specific data requirements of disparate AI platforms and adapt their data strategy accordingly. This will mean enriching product data, creating new data sets and implementing real-time data feeds to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. By embedding their offerings into broader AI networks, companies can maintain visibility and relevance as consumers increasingly rely on AI to guide their purchasing decisions. Work with AI partners to make your products and services discoverable on the platforms consumers are using to make purchasing decisions. For consumers, the primary driver for using AI tools is convenience—not price. While some may question whether consumers will always prioritize time over cost, this dynamic presents a significant opportunity for businesses to attract time-starved customers with a design-for-convenience mindset. Every experience leveraging AI must be fast and frictionless—for the consumer, and not just for the organization. AI-powered tools are already particularly well-suited to deliver convenience and speed through hyperspecialized recommendations, instant product comparisons and quick and reliable checkout processes. New agentic capabilities will only accelerate this. By integrating AI functionalities and agents that simplify complexities within the purchasing journey, companies can capture the interest of time-sensitive consumers, regardless of their existing attitudes toward AI or prior experience with the brand. Design every AI experience to be fast and frictionless for the consumer—not just for the business. Just as consumers have grown to trust mobile interfaces for high-stakes tasks, AI will gain acceptance as it becomes accessible through a variety of familiar and reliable devices, apps and platforms. To achieve this, businesses should prioritize an architecturally “headless” approach to AI, making its capabilities available everywhere and seamlessly integrating them into existing platforms and devices that feel natural to consumers, such as smartphones, voice assistants and laptops. This way, users can engage with AI through their preferred channels, mirroring the versatility of mobile internet access. As consumers become more accustomed to using AI in these trusted environments, their overall comfort with AI-powered decision-making in other areas of their lives will likely increase, even for high-stakes functions, such financial transactions or travel planning. Rather than feeling forced to use AI in certain contexts, consumers would likely embrace AI applications that feel like a natural extension of the tools and devices they already use. Make AI capabilities available to all the devices and platforms that feel natural to consumers, mirroring the versatility of mobile internet access. Even consumers who are comfortable using AI still value human interaction during critical moments. This preference is particularly evident in high-stakes purchases like healthcare or financial services, where trust and accountability are paramount. A set-it-and-forget it AI strategy simply won't cut it. The winning approach is a hybrid one that blends AI and human interactions. For instance, design customer experiences that incorporate AI for efficient product information gathering and initial inquiries. Then, ensure a smooth transition to human experts for complex questions, nuanced decision-making, and when empathy and a personal touch make all the difference. By emphasizing human oversight and accountability in their AI implementations, businesses can create a customer experience that works for a wide range of consumers and situations. Create a hybrid experience that ensures a smooth transition to human experts for complex questions, nuanced decision-making, and when empathy and a personal touch make all the difference. One-third of people in the world still have no access to the internet. For these people and other marginalized populations who don’t have the ability to adopt the latest technology, the transition to AI-powered purchase journeys and the agentic internet may feel like a leap they’re unable to make. This evolution could feel alienating enough when it comes to a favorite retailer or entertainment experience, but the issue becomes more acute when access to vital services becomes AI-influenced by default. Government services delivered via AI-brokered platforms, for example, or healthcare services offered only through the latest wearable technologies all present significant challenges to equitable access. Chief among business concerns, then, should be avoiding a wider digital divide within both developed markets and globally. One approach is to continue offering alternatives to AI-enabled experiences at key stages of the purchase journey. For example, businesses could integrate interactive AI tools into their brick-and-mortar locations to familiarize these groups with AI-enabled technology. Such an approach will ensure equal opportunity of access for all consumers until a greater level of education and democratization occurs in the usage of AI-enabled technology for all. Offer alternatives to AI experiences at key stages of the purchase journey to ensure equal opportunity of access for all consumers. The world of commerce has always been one of great change, from the industrial revolution to e-commerce. Today, we’re entering yet another new era of commerce, one marked by consumers delegating decision-making to AI-powered tools—an agentic approach to consumption. But there’s something different happening today. Whereas previous eras have been spurred by disruptive developments made on the business side of the commerce equation, this time, it’s a single group of consumers—people energized by the idea of using AI—who have already started the wheel of change spinning again. Certainly, it will be businesses that embed AI capabilities into purchasing journeys, but it’s consumers, increasingly comfortable with the technology and not even always aware they’re using it, who will get the ball rolling—and fast. At best, leaders have less than five years to grapple with this change. While the impact is most immediately obvious for consumer-facing businesses, the downstream effects will be felt across every industry. Will manufacturers form closer partnerships with retailers to avoid disintermediation, or will they go directly to consumers? How will banks manage the payments infrastructure that enables agent-to-agent transactions? How will transportation and logistics companies bear the weight of scaling this newly autonomous activity, delivering at higher volumes, faster speeds, and with increasingly personalized, complex requirements? Business leaders will need to rethink their internal roadmaps to become agentic enterprises—ready to compete in a world where human consumers, along with their AI agent counterparts, dictate the rules of engagement. Endnotes ¹ The Comfort Quotient is a score developed by Cognizant Research in order to quantify consumers’ willingness to engage with AI at each stage of the buyer’s journey. It focuses on analysis of the age groups most typically associated with each cohort (see Figure 1), with the exception of Early Adopters, who are identified by their stated willingness to be the first to use technology. The Comfort Quotient is based on Cognizant Research’s analysis of the survey data and qualitative findings, including respondents’ comfort levels with using numerous AI tools in the Learn, Buy and Use phases, and across 36 different products, services and experiences in 15 industries. ² Respondents were asked to select only their top reason for using or not using AI.

October 21, 2024 Gen AI is playing a major role in enabling product companies to become more customer focused. But it’s only part of the answer. A criticism of generative AI is that it’s mainly focused on increasing worker productivity. But, in fact, its hidden strength may be jumpstarting corporate productivity. Using generative AI’s ability to quickly churn through vast troves of data, product companies can —finally—jumpstart their customer-centricity strategies by shifting their focus from the products customers buy, to the customers themselves. Viewing customers as people rather than simply as users of the software, hardware or services they buy is a transition that businesses have been attempting for years. Now, by applying generative AI to the task and pairing it with organizational change, they can empower customer-facing employees with the information and cross-functional muscle they need to think and act in a customer-first way. Back when product companies were focused on selling licensed products, their core strength was engineering. The move to selling software as a service (SaaS) upended that sales model, but with a catch: The subscription model—and the recurring revenue it enables—requires ongoing customer engagement to support the rapid rollout of products and features. As a result, engineering now shares top billing with customer-facing functions like to sales, marketing and, especially, customer success. Successful products require not just great features and functionality but also a standout experience. But getting to know enterprise customers as more than just buyers of your products take a combination of data and organizational focus that most B2B product companies lack. We even hear businesses that sell sophisticated data-centric products admit to falling short on a customer focus within their own organizations. They know little about their buyers other than the software release or hardware model they use. Worse, they lack clarity on how customers use their products and even whether they’re happy with them. Enter gen AI. As companies make their way up the gen AI learning curve, we see growing numbers of businesses implementing AI as a productivity partner for achieving a customer focus. Here are three ways product companies are making the transition. Gen AI doesn’t enable customer centricity on its own—organizational change is also needed. Because customer service agents are on the front lines with customers—and take direct fire on what is and isn’t working—they’re a gold mine of product information. Yet too many businesses erect walls between the product design and engineering organization and the customer service function. Customer service leaders tell us they’re often left out of the product roadmap process and have no voice in product design—and are left to scramble to form support teams when products are released. To become fully customer centric, businesses need a bi-directional, closed-loop operating model where customer success and service is tightly coupled with the product organization. And gen AI, particularly LLMs, offer a tremendous opportunity to extract valuable insights that can be shared with product and customer functions. This style of human-first AI adoption is important to its success. The key here is to encourage collaboration and incentivize people to work together. By doing so, more companies can become invested in not just what the competition is doing but also what their own customer service agents are telling them. For example, as we scaled up the engineering and customer support for a leading marketing brand, they challenged us to make customer support integral to the product roadmap by identifying features to add to the backlog. In response, we created a synergistic approach, forming a cross-functional team that brought together customer service agents with data and AI experts as well as product managers. Make no doubt about it: The shift to customer centricity requires a lot of data and effort. Yet the payoff is a business primed for success.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. June 12, 2024 Here’s a look at three areas in which communications service providers can dramatically improve field operations with gen AI. For many customers, losing access to the internet, cell service, cable or satellite network is an existential and costly event. This is why fast-acting, efficient and effective field operations in the telecommunications industry is so vital. The problem is, field operations for communications service providers (CSP) is also an extremely intricate function to run. CSPs need to ensure work order information is complete and accurate, needed equipment and accessories are available at the right place and time, and junior technicians can get the support they need when servicing and supporting customers. When such challenges are not handled correctly, it not only results in a poor customer experience, but it also leads to operational overhead. In one assessment of a leading North American CSP, non-effective worktime for the field operations function ranged as high as 38%. Field services and operations is also a costly function to run—reaching 60% to 70% of CSP operating budgets, according to McKinsey. And another study reveals those costs have been rising 8% a year. Leading CSPs have been using rule-based automation, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in field operations to drive operational efficiencies. But now we’re seeing CSPs deploy generative AI in their field operations, which will elevate these operational efficiencies to a whole new level. Gen AI has the potential to simplify tasks by optimizing and automating various CSP field operations functions, thereby improving field operations productivity, enabling data-driven decisions, predicting outcomes, and prescribing and driving actions. Let’s take a look at three areas in which CSPs can dramatically improve field operations with generative AI: scheduling and dispatch operations, technician support and customer self-service. By doing so, they can cut costs, optimize workforce planning, enable operational agility, and boost both employee and customer experience. Field technician scheduling and dispatch plays a critical role in running efficient field operations. Schedulers and dispatchers must balance demand with not just field technicians’ availability but also numerous other internal and external factors. Although field service management software handles some of these needs, dispatchers and staff schedulers still struggle to create schedules that effectively respond to continuously shifting variables. Dispatchers can take advantage of gen AI models that not only analyze numerous parameters—such as workload distribution, shift patterns, and field techs’ skill level and preferences—but also adapt to unforeseen circumstances and optimize shift composition. With these capabilities, CSPs can maximize productivity, optimize the in-house vs. vendor technician ratio, minimize labor costs and improve technician satisfaction. Additionally, generative AI can automate the scheduling process, saving time and effort. Figure 1 Field technicians often require assistance from supervisors or specialized colleagues when working on install, maintenance and repair jobs. If that assistance doesn’t come in a timely manner, they end up spending more time on the job or needing a follow-up appointment to complete the job. This results in a subpar customer experience and higher costs for the CSP. Although CSPs have knowledge management tools to aid field technicians, generative AI can offer more guided assistance to field techs. A gen AI-driven smart coach can help field techs both prior to starting a job and during a job, providing insights and nudges to bridge skills gaps, and offer timely assistance and personalized recommendations. It can also be a vital tool once the job is complete because it can ensure the right root cause is assigned while closing the job. Our clients often point to the challenge of inaccurate assignment of root causes. Often, field techs select root causes from a drop-down menu at the end of the job, and the temptation is to choose the first or easiest option listed in their rush to close the work order. Gen AI can help by summarizing the job details and assisting with root cause assignment by recognizing patterns in job descriptions and resolution details. Figure 2 Truck rolls are a necessary part of CSP field operations. There will always be situations that warrant dispatching a field technician to a customer location for install, repair and maintenance jobs. However, there are also plenty of cases where customers can resolve issues with guidance from their CSP. Most CSPs have customer-facing virtual assistants. But by augmenting these virtual assistants with gen AI, these tools can guide customers on a wider array of service configuration and activation tasks and resolve service anomaly issues. Not only does this reduce time to value for customers, but it also reduces truck rolls. Beyond solving the immediate issue, the virtual field assistant could also elevate the customer experience with product recommendations based on prior learning and experience. Figure 3 Here are three steps CSPs can take to start or accelerate their gen AI field operations journey: 1)    Identify gen AI use cases that materially elevate the field operations journey. CSPs should identify gen AI use cases that will create and deliver distinct, significant incremental value. This assessment should include both use cases that currently utilize traditional AI/ML and ones that are net new.

Certain use cases will need to be put on the back burner until underlying technology and regulatory landscapes mature. These include those involving complex decisions, safety considerations and legal implications, as well as use cases that specifically benefit from human oversight.

The key is to start by focusing on field operations use cases that gen AI can handle optimally. Then, categorize and prioritize these use cases based on impact, feasibility and ease of implementation (i.e., quick wins, big bets). 2)    Set up data capabilities and practices for gen AI. A big factor in the feasibility and ease of gen AI use case implementation is data: the availability, ownership and readiness of field operations data, as well as the CSP’s overall data capabilities, including data infrastructure, data literacy/fluency and data processes.

To implement a use case such as the smart coach described above, field operations will need to integrate data from systems most likely owned by other business functions, such as human resources (i.e., performance management and learning and development systems).

Leading CSPs with advanced data capabilities are better equipped to support gen AI. Others can catch up by establishing a roadmap for their data infrastructure, making their data processes gen AI-ready, and training and empowering their field tech personnel to be fluent in handling data. 3)    Approach implementation decisions with well-informed perspectives. When it comes to implementation, it mostly comes down to the decision of procuring a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) gen AI application/model and providing the necessary data, context and training or custom-building the gen AI application/models.

When answering the build vs. buy question, CSPs should start with the concept of business value and broader objectives and think beyond the output of the system. Key considerations include in-house talent, time to market/value requirements and total cost of ownership.

Additionally, CSPs should evaluate the foundational model, complexity and methodology involved in making the AI models fit the needs of the field operations use cases (i.e., prompt /context learning, fine-tuning). The answer isn’t to do nothing or take a wait-and-watch approach. CSPs should work with the right external experts, consultants or partners to help research and make decisions if they don’t want to go it alone. With the right balance of quick-win and big-bet field operations gen AI use cases—along with data capabilities and applications and models that enable implementation—field operations will have the foundational elements they need to start or accelerate their gen AI journey. Sustained success comes with executive support, vision, strategy and roadmaps that enable field operations to weave gen AI throughout their processes. The journey will require a strong commitment, and few CSPs will choose to do this entirely on their own. CSPs must identify and work with trusted partners that will support them through shared financial success models.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. July 08, 2024 Generative AI promises to help solve the massive reskilling issue it creates by reinvigorating businesses’ approach to learning and development. When it comes to reskilling, generative AI is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, businesses will soon find themselves in dire need of a workforce reskilling program, with gen AI set to disrupt 90% of jobs by 2032, according to our recent research. In just two years’ time, according to another study, executives believe nearly half the skills that exist in today’s workforce won’t be relevant because of AI. On the other hand, generative AI also promises to help solve the massive reskilling issue it creates. With its ability to quickly analyze vast datasets, generative AI can help organizations create continuously updated knowledge management repositories, identify evolving skill trends and create adaptive and personalized learning content that ensures organizations stay ahead of industry changes. Businesses are taking note. A recent study found a higher percentage of survey participants anticipating learning and development (L&D) technology budget increases (24%) in the next fiscal year than decreases (17%). This was significantly greater for high-performance organizations (39% increase vs. 4% decrease). More than one in five respondents said generative AI would be an L&D technology priority for the next 12 months, and that number doubled among high-performance organizations. Such enthusiasm is well-timed. According to BCG, businesses in general have not prioritized skill development to date. Despite leading companies spending up to 1.5% of their annual budgets on learning and skill building, according to the consultancy, their leaders do not discuss skill building in the same way they do other goals, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. BCG found that 20% do not include any mention of learning or skill building, and in many others, the topic is only touched on in a generic paragraph on human resources or social responsibility. With the introduction of gen AI across the business landscape, this needs to change. Not only will workers need to learn how to work with generative AI to make them more productive, but they’ll also need to learn new skills as the technology automates some of the tasks they’ve traditionally performed. At Cognizant, for instance, we are institutionalizing gen AI-led knowledge management as a co-pilot for employees to design and learn personalized content at their own pace. Here are four key ways in which generative AI can help businesses reinvigorate their learning and development programs to meet the skilling needs of today’s workforce: To succeed with generative AI in learning and skilling, businesses need to address several key elements: A robust governance system is critical to drive adoption, measure business impact and provide continuous feedback to employees and executives. By some estimates, the average half-life of skills is now less than five years, and in some tech fields, it’s as low as 2.5. With the integration of generative AI and a “human in the loop” model, businesses can ensure resilience and continuity in an era defined by constant change.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. Watch how decision AI orchestrates advanced technologies to not only predict but prescribe better actions, transforming decision-making for businesses. Decision AI is at the core of the Neuro® AI platform, designed to revolutionize decision-making across enterprises. This next-generation AI framework integrates multiple AI technologies including multi-agent orchestration, generative AI, deep learning, evolutionary AI, and trustworthy AI techniques into one powerful decisioning engine, empowering businesses to predict outcomes, optimize strategies and drive growth and innovation. Decision AI goes beyond predicting insights that help you make decisions—it prescribes actionable strategies using multiple AI technologies to balance competing objectives and improve KPIs. Provides data-driven recommendation Balances conflicting business objectives Scales AI solutions across the business Ensures decisions are explainable and trustworthy Together, these advanced AI technologies drive optimized decisions that transform complex data into strategic outcomes. Multi-agent orchestration is a foundational component of decision AI, enabling a network of specialized agents to interact not only with humans but also with each other. Every agent handles a distinct task, such as data generation or prediction, while communicating across domains to ensure decisions are optimized throughout the organization. This real-time interaction allows for adaptive, holistic AI systems that drive efficiency and innovation. Core capabilities: Leveraging large language models (LLMs), it generates synthetic data, simulates potential outcomes and explores creative solutions that support decision-making by offering new insights and possibilities. By modeling various scenarios and crafting data-driven strategies, generative AI empowers businesses to make proactive, well-informed decisions across industries, even in the absence of complete data. Core capabilities: Deep learning is primarily used for prediction and processing large datasets through neural networks to identify patterns that traditional analytics might miss. By learning from data specific to the problem at hand, deep learning enhances decision-making through more accurate predictions and insights, enabling businesses to anticipate future trends and make more informed decisions. Core capabilities: Evolutionary AI prescribes optimal strategies by mimicking the process of natural selection, retaining only the most effective or “fittest” strategies over time. It tests multiple solutions simultaneously, prescribing actions that meet conflicting objectives like performance, cost and efficiency. By adapting to updated predictor models, evolutionary AI ensures that decision models stay relevant and drive continuous business growth. Core capabilities: Trustworthy AI is built on essential techniques that ensure AI outputs are reliable, explainable and transparent. These include uncertainty estimation to gauge confidence in predictions, explainability methods to clarify decision logic through rule sets, and interactive tools that allow users to explore variations and alternative solutions. Core capabilities: With decision AI, we are committed to revolutionizing how enterprises operate, providing the intelligence and adaptability needed for today’s fast-paced environments. Our integrated AI-driven approach ensures that enterprises can transform data into actionable strategies, unlock new opportunities across their operations and deliver impactful results at scale. Serving customers by looking forward as well as back is a big promise, but the power of today’s new digital capabilities is vast and growing.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. Understanding how generative AI will affect your profession is crucial in career planning. Our interactive tool helps you prepare by quantifying how the fast-moving technology will impact you. To get started, enter your job role. Your exposure score reflects the degree to which your occupation could be affected by generative AI. It takes into account how many of your job's tasks could be fully automated by gen AI;
                                    how many could be assisted; and the relative importance of these tasks. A lower exposure score means a lower percent of your job's tasks will be automated, so your profession will be relatively unaffected.
                                    The chart shows your exposure score in both 2023 and 2032. Theoretical maximum Exposure score* Now that you know your exposure score, let's move on to your friction score. What does this mean? The friction score measures how difficult it will be for workers displaced by gen AI to find new employment with their existing skills. A high friction score means it could be more challenging for you to find new work. This chart shows your friction score in 2027, which forms the midpoint of our analysis. Find out more about your occupational group Now let's put your exposure score and friction score to work to see what your job will look like five years from now. The four quadrants on this chart illustrate the impact gen AI will have on both the tasks that make up your job and the ease with which you will find work in your field. Data in this chart represents predicted exposure scores versus theoretical maximum exposure scores. See methodology for how these scores are calculated. Bubble size represents the relative number of workers in the job category. Color coding of bubbles corresponds to wage quintile in 2022, with darkest blue representing the fifth quintile and lightest representing the first.

Cognizant,Get Future Ready with AI | Cognizant,"Business interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has never been higher. But even before generative AI was introduced, organizations were struggling to get the full value out of their AI implementations, according to our analysis of a recent Economist Impact study. Here are five changes businesses should make to succeed with AI. Source: O’Reilly Prioritize data quality over data quantity: The value lies not in the size of the dataset but in its quality. By curating a high-quality dataset, organizations lay the foundation for valuable insights and outcomes that drive innovation and success. Establish a robust data governance framework: Clear policies, procedures and guidelines establish a foundation for consistent data governance. According to the Economist Impact study, the top three data governance guidelines followed by companies include data quality metrics and thresholds (54%); procedures for data privacy management (53%); and guidelines for data collection, storage and use (53%). Embrace the power of data virtualization: Data virtualization creates a consolidated view of disparate data sources, enabling real-time access and analysis without the need for complex data integration processes. Because it breaks down data silos, data virtualization enhances agility, enables faster decision-making and amplifies the impact of AI initiatives. Augment data with external sources: Integrating additional information, such as demographic data, social media insights or industry-specific datasets, enriches the depth and breadth of data. This augmentation empowers organizations to develop more robust AI models, enabling smarter decision-making and driving innovation in the process. By prioritizing data quality and leveraging AI, healthcare organizations can enable more accurate diagnoses, precision medicine approaches, proactive disease management and improved clinical decision-making. Establishing a robust data governance framework ensures regulatory compliance, protects customer privacy and mitigates data breach risks. AI models trained on financial data adhere to standards like GDPR or PCI-DSS, safeguarding sensitive information in the financial services industry. By integrating external data sources and leveraging AI models, insurers can enhance risk assessment, streamline claims, personalize experiences, improve fraud detection, and optimize underwriting and pricing strategies. Source: Mechanical Orchard, US-based cloud consultancy Make cloud core to your infrastructure strategy: Migrate legacy systems and applications to the cloud to leverage the power of scalable computing resources, rapid deployment and pre-built AI services. By harnessing the cloud, organizations can unlock new levels of agility and tap into the full potential of AI. Adopt agile development practices: Agile practices promote collaboration, continuous integration and rapid deployment, enabling organizations to stay nimble and responsive in the fast-evolving AI landscape. Upgrade networking and connectivity: Embrace high-speed networks, software-defined networking (SDN), and reliable connectivity to facilitate the smooth exchange of data between AI systems, data sources and users. By upgrading networking capabilities, organizations can ensure optimal performance, responsiveness and reliability. Implement robust security measures: Because AI relies on sensitive data, it is crucial to implement robust security measures to protect data and AI models from unauthorized access. Embrace encryption, access controls and advanced threat detection to safeguard your AI initiatives, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and fostering trust among stakeholders. By migrating legacy systems to the cloud, healthcare providers can leverage scalable computing resources to support AI-driven diagnostic models. Real-time insights derived from vast amounts of patient data empower healthcare professionals to make more accurate diagnoses, create personalized treatment plans and improve patient outcomes. With agile development practices, retailers can rapidly deploy AI-driven solutions, such as demand forecasting models, recommendation engines and dynamic pricing algorithms. This enables retailers to respond swiftly to changing market dynamics, provide personalized shopping experiences, optimize inventory management and increase customer satisfaction. The banking and finance industry heavily relies on AI for fraud detection, risk assessment and customer authentication. By implementing encryption, access controls and advanced threat detection, financial institutions can build trust among customers, ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate risk. Foster internal talent development: Identify individuals who show promise and passion for AI and invest in their development by offering comprehensive training programs, mentorship and other resources to enhance their AI skills. Unlock the power of diversity: A diverse workforce fosters creativity and innovation, promoting a collaborative environment where different perspectives thrive. It helps overcome the scarcity of multidisciplinary talents by expanding the pool of potential candidates. Gain access to vast talent pools through strategic partnerships: Strategic partners offer expertise and networks that extend beyond your organization's boundaries. By collaborating with partners, you tap into their extensive talent pool, gaining access to a diverse range of AI professionals with specialized skills and experiences. Make use of AI models: By harnessing AI models, businesses can assess the uncertainty inherent in their AI systems. This approach not only empowers organizations to gauge the reliability and confidence levels of AI predictions, but it also enables business leaders to make informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of the associated uncertainties. Utilize transparent and inherently explainable AI systems: Approaches such as rule-set evolution can help businesses understand and explain the AI system’s decision-making processes by ensuring the models are transparent and explainable to begin with. This approach not only addresses concerns surrounding the ""black box"" nature of AI but also positions organizations as pioneers in responsible and ethical AI adoption. Define and measure unwanted biases and set a goal to minimize them: It is essential to establish clear guidelines and metrics to quantify biases within AI models and ensure fairness in outcomes. By setting the goal of minimizing bias as a primary objective for AI system optimization, businesses demonstrate a commitment to ethical practices and equitable decision-making. Source: Forbes Advisor Lead from the top: Leadership sets the tone for an AI-friendly culture. By championing AI initiatives, fostering open dialog and sharing success stories, leaders can inspire their workforce. Embrace transparency: Communicate with clarity and purpose. Paint a vivid picture of why AI adoption is vital, showcasing its potential to augment rather than replace employees. Assure them of the organization's unwavering support during the transition. Promote AI literacy: Conduct training programs, workshops and knowledge-sharing sessions to demystify AI concepts and terminology. Nurture employees’ understanding and provide them with the skills to collaborate seamlessly with AI systems. The starting point lies in understanding what differentiates your organization in the market. What sets you apart from the competition? What distinctive value proposition can AI help magnify? By identifying these crucial differentiators, you can lay the foundation for a clear and compelling vision of how AI can elevate and accentuate your strengths. This vision will empower you to outshine competitors, meet evolving customer demands and pave the way for unrivaled success. With a bold vision in place, the next step is to create a roadmap that outlines the strategic steps and milestones necessary to bring your AI-powered future to fruition. Begin by identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with your organizational objectives and AI-enabled differentiators. These KPIs will serve as beacons, illuminating your path and enabling you to measure the success and impact of your AI initiatives. By leveraging AI technologies, companies can seamlessly integrate intelligent automation, data-driven insights and advanced analytics into their workflows. AI-enhanced processes enable data-driven insights, empowering decision-makers with real-time information for agile and informed decision-making. By embracing AI-driven efficiency, businesses can unlock a new era of productivity, agility and unparalleled success.",https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/aem-i/future-ready-ai

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. January 25, 2024 As media bigwigs ward off the threat of gen AI, the spotlight might shine on blockchain as a viable solution. The media vs. generative AI wars are raising the classic question: whether to “beat ’em” or “join ’em.” And as the various media players make their moves, another question is emerging: whether to ward off the threats of one powerful technology—generative AI—with another one: blockchain. At issue is generative AI makers’ reliance on online content to train their models and supply answers to user queries—sometimes with word-for-word outtakes from published articles. The New York Times has taken a decidedly “beat ‘em” approach by filing a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming that by using its content to train their generative AI programs, the tech titans are threatening its livelihood. Meanwhile, global media publisher Axel Springer joined forces with OpenAI by signing a blockbuster deal to make its Politico, Business Insider, Bild and other content available for model training and ChatGPT responses. In exchange, OpenAI will clearly brand the source of the material and link to the original source. For its part, US media giant Fox Corp. is leveraging its previous investment in blockchain to unveil a platform that can track where and how its content is used online. In addition to using the platform, dubbed Verify, itself, Fox also aims to license it to other industry players—suggesting that “the tool will give them leverage in their negotiations with AI companies.” All three of these cases highlight the role of media-developed content in a landscape increasingly influenced by generative AI. But the Fox case is interesting in another way, too: as a real-world example of blockchain’s emerging utility. Blockchain is best known as the engine on which cryptocurrency runs, but use cases are taking hold in multiple industries. In healthcare, blockchain is being used to enhance information sharing and transparency, notably around medical records and pharmaceutical supply chains. In banking and financial services, the technology is used to manage payments and loans and administer smart contracts by such major firms as Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase. And in agriculture, blockchain has quickly become an essential tool for food supply chain traceability. For part of the general public, blockchain may be widely associated with crypto-catastrophes such as the 2023 downfall of FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. But in business, the story is quite different. And with the mainstreaming of generative AI, blockchain may be a very good complementary partner. In the public mind, there’s only room for one It Girl technology at a time; these days, that means folks choose among virtual reality, generative AI, and blockchain, then root for their fave as if it were a sports team. The reality, says Duncan Roberts, a Senior Manager at Cognizant Research, is far different—and far more productive. “Gen AI and blockchain are actually quite complementary technologies,” he notes. For instance, generative AI tends to be a highly centralizing tech. “Very few have the ability to run their own large language model, so you’re beholden to a central service provider, and thus to what they decide their LLM will do,” Roberts says. Blockchain, on the other hand, is all about decentralization—taking trust away from a single authority and embedding it into the mechanisms of the blockchain itself. It’s a topic Roberts has written about; he advises thinking of blockchain as a sort of auditor “that complements gen AI—and AI has issues around copyright tracking.” Regarding the recent goings-on at media companies, he adds that “Intellectual property management is a strong blockchain use case. Who created a given bit of content? Who should be rewarded for its use? Blockchain is useful anytime you need verification of a database.” History shows that demanding the cessation of use of any given technology is seldom fruitful; those who take the “join ’em” approach—and can then commercialize the tech mechanisms supporting it—may be more likely to succeed. Understand the transformative impact of emerging technologies on the world around us as they address our most significant global challenges. editorialboard@cognizant.com Follow us Visit the Banking section of our website.

June 29, 2023 Even if gen AI doesn’t write the next bestseller, lessons of its use in the arts can be applied to business use, generally. You can ask your favorite generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) program to write a report. You can ask it to write tips on securing corporate data, managing Gen Z or growing tomatoes. But don’t ask it to write an episode of the TV show Black Mirror. Charlie Brooker, creator of the hit Netflix series, asked ChatGPT to do just that. The results, Brooker said, were not so good. (His language was more colorful, as the linked story reveals.) The world is exploring the possibilities and limitations of generative AI. While some seem to fear the technology will write and star in feature films, and create the prints we buy at Home Goods, others are suggesting it’s time to pump the brakes. Thomas Rabe, the CEO of Germany-based media conglomerate Bertelsmann, made news recently by saying gen AI could be “very positive provided we stay on top of it and understand its potential and threats.” Those threats may prove thorny indeed. An image created with generative AI has already won an art contest, infuriating human entrants. And it is now common to use existing music to train generative AI programs that write songs—causing much copyright consternation in that industry. Business leaders would do well to heed Rabe and explore generative AI, rather than building barriers against its use. As we wrote recently, these tools “will increasingly be used to facilitate some rudimentary tasks,” such as basic copywriting. But when it comes to creations demanding nuance and subtlety, they should be viewed as assistants, not replacements. Additional experience with ChatGPT, Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Bing Chat reinforce this analysis. When tasked with writing a report on a business topic such as digital transformation, these programs produce results that bring to mind a paper written at the last minute by a furiously Googling college freshman. While not incorrect, the content is flat, derivative and unimaginative. Which is not to say it’s useless. One of generative AI’s strengths, experience shows, is structure. It tends to organize material handsomely and produce documents of a reasonable length. So, the result of that query on digital transformation could be considered a strong outline and acceptable first draft. What’s left for human attention is to add interest by varying sentence structure; remove redundancies that remind readers of that panicky college student (“another benefit to the organization of digital transformation is …”); and insert details most pertinent to the intended audience. The strengths and weaknesses of generative AI demonstrate the path that forward-looking creative people should follow: Develop new skills that leverage the technology. Already, generating powerful prompts is a desirable skill in writing, code generation and other arenas. Both generative AI and those who use it must be trained to maximize its potential. Organizations will need editors to meld software- and human-created content. It's also important to remember that generative AI in its current accessible form is in its infancy. It will follow the path established by tech through the ages, becoming better and less expensive; eventually, it will be baked into other apps. Microsoft Word already prompts authors to use inclusive language and appropriate levels of formality. It’s not much of a leap to envision this sort of assistance expanding further. For business leaders, the wise move today is to encourage experimentation with generative AI, all the while thinking of it as a helping hand, rather than a replacement. Understand the transformative impact of emerging technologies on the world around us as they address our most significant global challenges. editorialboard@cognizant.com Follow us Sign up for the Cognizant newsletter to gain actionable AI advice and real-world business insights delivered to your inbox every month. ©2025 Cognizant, all rights reserved",https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/insights/insights-blog/gen-ai-is-no-screenwriter-yet-wf1951868

October 10, 2023 The travel and transport industry is in need of an upgrade. Does generative AI hold the key? When New York International Airport opened in 1948, it had six runways with a seventh under construction. For the first few years of operation, the airport managed just 73 takeoffs and landings per day and was expected to accommodate about 3.5 million passengers annually. Fast-forward to the present day and this facility now goes by the name of John F. Kennedy International Airport. The airport has grown to six terminals, serving an average of 2.7 million passengers per month with an estimated 2,400 takeoffs and landings each day. Congested and prone to delays, many industry experts say the airport was never designed to handle the volume of flights and passengers it does currently – especially when the flight volume for surrounding airports has also increased dramatically. Unfortunately, New York City-area airports aren’t the only facilities struggling to meet increases in traffic and changes in demand. In fact, much of the infrastructure used by the travel and transportation industry, including rail, roads, and ports, was built decades ago and never intended to serve at the current scale. Lack of investment to modernize, upgrade and expand these facilities and assets has contributed to inefficiency, and prompted ongoing questions about reliability and safety. At the same time, even as these industries are experiencing significant growth, they are facing mounting pressure to reduce emissions and shrink their carbon footprint. As the travel and transportation industries seek solutions to their current challenges, generative AI has emerged as a potential answer, enabling new levels of multi-modality, sustainability, inclusivity, and self-healing capabilities. But with the possibilities of this technology virtually limitless, where and how should organizations focus their efforts to achieve the most value? In this article, we explore the potential of gen AI across a range of industry-specific use cases. We will also offer practical considerations for organizations looking to advance their generative AI journey while staying true to their ethics and their principles. Source: Cognizant Research
Figure 1 Rapid advancement of generative AI in just the past year has underscored the implications of this new technology—implications so vast that many companies may find them overwhelming. To help, our team has highlighted seven features of generative AI that are of particular use in the travel and transportation industries. In the table below we summarize these functions and their possible applications. In the following section, we’ll go into more detail, showing gen AI’s transformative power in seven distinct industry use cases. Figure 2 Personalizing customer experiences is important in almost every sector, but in the travel industry, where experience is the product, personalization is everything. The content-producing capabilities of generative AI enables travel organizations to create personalized content at scale. For example, travel operators can create personalized itineraries based on customer prompts, incorporating not only a traveler’s preferences, but external factors such as weather forecasts, passenger location, nearby special events and more. Development of these applications is well underway. For instance, Trip.com released a ChatGPT-powered plugin to deliver customized product recommendations and assist with itinerary planning. Users can enter their destination, trip dates and other preferences to reveal a suggested itinerary based on their prompts. In many cases, offering personalized services also opens up opportunities for cross-selling and up-selling. For example, a company that offers personalized itinerary planning can integrate third-party sites, such as local restaurants and attractions, and offer their users the added convenience of one-click booking. A hyper-personalized customer experience goes beyond booking and planning capabilities, though. Other applications include: Essential to personalizing the travel experience is creating a more inclusive experience for travelers. This can take any number of forms: from personalized recommendations for accessible accommodations and routes, to providing customer support in a variety of local languages. For example, MakeMyTrip, India’s leading travel company, introduced voice-assisted booking in Indian languages to make the platform more inclusive and accessible. MakeMyTrip’s CTO, Sanjay Mohan, estimates that this feature will open the travel industry to 100-200 million new users who prefer to communicate in their native language and use a voice system, rather than a mobile app. Mohan also says the tool will help improve accessibility for users with disabilities who sometimes cannot use traditional digital tools. Additional applications: Generative AI can be used to influence passenger behavior and enable a modal shift towards more sustainable options. For example, a city council may leverage generative AI to power a mobile app that produces customized walking, cycling or public transportation routes that will not only take the user to their final destination, but also pass a number of popular landmarks, cafés and restaurants along the way. The app could also calculate the amount of carbon offset by these more sustainable travel methods and suggest opportunities for people to reduce their carbon footprint when traveling. Additional applications: Data has long been used in the transport industry to help improve efficiency, avoid delays and cut costs. With the advanced features of generative AI, transportation operators can now gather, summarize and analyze data from a vast number of sources in real-time, enabling operators to respond with greater accuracy and precision to disruptions, helping them unlock new levels of operational efficiency. For example, generative AI can streamline operations and improve decision-making by automating sensor data collection and extracting data from video feed and incident logs to present insights in a structured format. An airline can use data to optimize flight paths, based on an aircraft’s maintenance history, weather patterns, flight conditions or other factors. Additional applications: Employees in the travel and transport sectors make decisions based on a large volume of structures, as well as unstructured data, including telemetry, remote sensing devices, operations logs, and video feeds. Managing this unstructured data, including the large volume of historic records, is extremely challenging and often contributes to sub-optimal decision-making. Gen AI’s extraction features can process this high volume of unstructured real-time data, as well as historic data, into a single accessible format, helping workers make better decisions—on everything from scheduling and rostering to compliance and safety. Gen AI can also be used to power next generation chatbots, which can automate some aspects of the customer service function, and help agents determine how to respond to more complex situations. Indeed, Air India recently invested $200M in ChatGPT to improve the capabilities of its digital workforce. The airline will use a generative AI-enabled chatbot to automate real-time customer support, improve existing FAQ content, enhance pilot briefings and more. Additional applications: An efficient transportation system relies on the health of its underlying infrastructure. In many parts of the world, unfortunately, the roads, railways, airports and ports we use today were built decades ago and often suffer from service-affecting failures which result in travel disruptions. Understanding these assets and their conditions lets operators take a proactive approach to maintenance. Gen AI’s extraction feature can help analyze data from historic records and maintenance logs (as well as unstructured data sets like engineering schematics and models) to conduct risk assessments and detect potential anomalies. At the same time, using gen AI technology to manage data collection and analysis can significantly reduce the workload of asset engineers. Having access to accurate, timely data lets them make better decisions about where to focus efforts and prioritize resources. Additional applications: Safety is any travel or transportation company’s top priority, and gen AI can help improve it. For example, generative AI can extract data from incident logs, historic health and safety reports and video feeds of incidents or near-miss instances and use it to identify patterns and suggest actionable steps toward improvement. Gen AI can also analyze traffic sensor data, video feeds, telemetry and GPS data to identify potential violations of traffic laws, even drafting new safety protocols, emergency response plans, and standardized procedures. Additional application: While generative AI is evolving rapidly and the regulatory landscape remains unclear, we believe that companies need to begin laying the groundwork now. Let these five key steps guide your gen AI journey: After almost a year of gen AI headlines, travel and transportation companies are recognizing that it’s no longer a question of if but when this technology will play a role in the future of their business. In this article, we explored several ways that generative AI will change the way these industries operate—but gen AI is a moving target. Its capabilities expand every day, which requires organizations to constantly evaluate new use cases, and revisit their guidelines for using this technology safely and securely. The road ahead is complex, to be sure. But it’s a road worth taking given the technology’s potential to solve many of the industries’ perennial challenges. We hope you join us in this journey from point A to point AI, making our industry more efficient, inclusive, safe and sustainable.

July 12, 2024 Advice for new graduates on embracing AI as they navigate their professional growth. This summer, a wave of new graduates will land their first jobs and enter the workforce. As they build out their new professional networks, they’ll also grapple with an emerging and daunting consideration: How might generative AI affect their roles over the coming years? In our recent study conducted with Oxford Economics, we found generative AI could disrupt the vast majority of jobs (90%) in some way by 2032. This signals significant change ahead, but it also points to an evolving workplace where employees and employers can begin embracing new opportunities for professional growth now. In this blog, Cognizant leaders share their insights on how they think AI could impact the future of work, and their advice for new graduates on how to harness AI today to fuel their professional growth. We’re at a turning point for professional growth. Because generative AI makes human skillsets more valuable, new graduates should use this moment as a springboard to expand their capabilities, try new roles and become more versatile. We’re moving from what could be called a “structured” learning environment to an “unstructured” one. Learning is no longer an experience reserved for academic institutions, under the guidance of professors and syllabi. We’re all in charge of our own learning journeys now. We need to think of ourselves as learning athletes. Gen AI is becoming as crucial as Microsoft Office once was, serving as a sophisticated assistant across sectors. In jobs like engineering, research, business ideation, planning and data analysis, graduates will need to learn to harness gen AI for complex challenges, such as analyzing data for ocean conservation to support UN goals. Merging gen AI with domain expertise enables the creation of integrated, AI-driven solutions. In logistics, for instance, gen AI can enhance fuel efficiency, balancing costs and regulations. Gen AI is revolutionizing the job market, automating routine tasks and reshaping industry roles. Despite concerns about AI replacing writers and actors, such as the disputes involving Scarlett Johansson and OpenAI, the industry intends to utilize generative AI to augment, rather than supplant, human creativity. In media, gen AI expedites localization, and graduates entering roles that involve translation will need to begin refining translations rather than creating them. Companies like AT&T are integrating gen AI to improve learning and customer experiences. In the evolving job market, banks are prioritizing technology, fostering innovation and upskilling. By 2035, advanced AI could manage finances with personalized insights, revolutionizing banking with quantum machine learning. To seize these opportunities as they enter the banking industry, graduates must master data analysis and AI tool proficiency. The key to thriving in the digital workforce is embracing gen AI early. This will allow them to combine human insight with AI, navigating the future’s myriad career possibilities with confidence and potential. The manufacturing industry, a global economic pillar, is poised for growth, with a projected 1.96 million new US jobs by 2028 and the smart manufacturing market booming to USD 985.5 billion by 2032. This shift demands that graduates entering roles like analyst, engineer and operations coordinator embrace gen AI to innovate and enhance product strategies. The new workforce must integrate generative AI into their skillset, ensuring they contribute to the industry’s evolution and maintain customer satisfaction through continuous product improvement.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. March 08, 2024 Value-driven, scalable gen AI programs can deliver a lasting competitive advantage for biopharma firms. But only if they move quickly and think differently. In March 2023, NVIDIA launched BioNeMo™, a cloud service that aimed to accelerate drug research and discovery through large language models and generative AI. At the time, media coverage focused on the platform’s potential—how it might rapidly identify potential drug molecules, predict their interactions in the body, and even simulate some aspects of clinical trials. A year later, it looks like the hype around BioNeMo may, if anything, have understated its potential. In the words of David M. Reese, CTO of Amgen, an early-access customer of the service, BioNeMo has been a “hinge moment” for his company, which will soon be using the service. It will train state-of-the-art AI models on one of the world’s largest human datasets in a matter of days rather than months. That could mean significant improvements in time to market, particularly impacting drug discovery and phase 1 clinical trials. Amgen’s proactive embrace of gen AI, in other words, is already bearing fruit, with the prospect of even richer harvests in coming years. For other life sciences companies that want to follow suit, they need to move quickly and think differently. As a starting point, in this post we offer five core truths that companies can embrace to create value-driven, scalable generative AI programs and turn them into a multi-year competitive advantage. While there is a dizzying number of exciting potential use cases for generative AI in the life sciences arena, it makes sense to focus initial investments on those that either shorten the discovery and development periods or amplify the scalability of treatments post-market. As every pharmaceutical leader knows, the success of a new drug is a matter of speed and scale. Companies usually have between five and eight years to recoup the discovery and development costs of bringing that new drug to market…and funding the next one. When it comes to gen AI, an adoption strategy that puts speed and scale first is the key to realizing a competitive advantage. On the clinical front, this approach may resemble Amgen’s collaboration with NVIDIA, streamlining discovery and development phases through the application of advanced models that swiftly evaluate molecules, or facilitate in silico clinical trials. On the commercial side, generative AI is an invaluable tool to help educate healthcare professionals, hospitals, payers, insurance companies and even patients about a treatment’s value, thus helping companies capitalize on the limited in-market growth phase. Efforts here can take the form of microbrand launches, precision targeting of HCPs, optimized contracting and pricing strategies, more personalized customer and patient engagement, and/or better field force effectiveness. In the end, the main commercial objective should be accelerating access to therapy and care to all eligible patients. That drives better patient outcomes, which in turn drives better business outcomes. Figure 1 Takeda Pharmaceuticals’ experimental psoriasis drug, which was purchased from U.S. startup Nimbus Therapeutics, is based on a compound that was discovered by an AI-enabled algorithm. The model identified the compound in just 6 months – nearly three times faster than the usual 2-year candidate molecule discovery period. While gen AI is grabbing headlines in this story, the unsung hero is really the data being used by the model. As with any system, the old adage of “garbage in, garbage out” applies to gen AI tools. As life sciences companies begin their AI journey, they must take a long, unflinching look their data estate. Do they already have the accurate, complete, timely and relevant data they need to support and scale use cases? Or should they spend time and resources building the solid data foundation so critical to generative AI? Either way, time is of the essence. Only with robust data “plumbing” in place can companies start reaping competitive advantage—both in the short term, the so-called “experimentation phase,” and the ensuing period of “confident adoption” where that competitive advantage can be widened. We recommend democratizing data access across the life sciences ecosystem through a process that automates data infrastructure and establishes a sturdy governance framework. Want to learn more about what’s on the horizon for gen AI adoption? Check out our latest report, New Work, New World, which explores how enterprise use of generative AI is expected to evolve over the next 8 years. If we accept the idea that creating a competitive advantage from gen AI requires companies to act quickly, then it will in most cases rule out the idea of building an LLM from scratch. The alternative is to use one of many existing public models—but these have their limitations. While an out-of-the-box solution may be the quickest way to jumpstart a gen AI program—especially for commercial applications—that can make it harder to leverage the proprietary data that is key to many advanced use cases. (Not only that, but there is currently an active debate over whether and to what extent commercial AI models can use copyrighted information in their training process. While the resolution of this legal issue is still pending, companies should view it as a potential downside of so-called “public” LLMs as they’re formulating their gen AI strategies, particularly when relying on public models.) For many organizations, the optimal solution lies somewhere in the middle: so-called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a way to optimize a commercial LLM with data from a private, authoritative knowledge base. Regardless, if that combination shakes out, the output should have a high degree of transparency regarding the source(s) that were used to generate a given response. This is where forming partnerships can help an organization start experimenting and exploring right away. In many cases, these partners can help companies fine tune an existing model to meet their specific needs, enabling them to quickly build powerful, customized applications while ensuring the safe and secure use of proprietary data. Pfizer recently developed Clear AI, an evidence-based, gen-AI enabled health literacy tool that checks the readability, understandability and actionability of written texts. The tool has already been incorporated into all core content creation workflows in the United States and the company has plans to adapt it for global use. It’s fun to speculate about hype cycles, and gen AI may be a boardroom favorite today. But it won’t be long—12-18 months? —before the board will want to see results. It’s important, therefore, for those stewarding the first phase of gen AI adoption to choose use cases that will yield quantifiable results to justify additional investments. The most logical place for most biopharma companies to start is with commercial use cases that span sales, marketing, customer care and market access. These use cases can offer substantial productivity gains of up to 45%, helping companies build awareness of new drugs without introducing significant regulatory risk. Figure 2 As discussed earlier, it’s important to organize all use cases within an overarching framework that lets teams consistently demonstrate the value of programs, scale successful initiatives and continuously iterate to drive improvement. In June 2023, Sanofi launched plai, an AI-powered app that aggregates data from across the business, providing a 360-degree view of all activities and producing insights that help teams make better decisions. According to media reports, an estimated 10% of Sanofi’s workforce of 80,000 people use the app daily to do everything from monitor inventory levels to schedule meetings. Gen AI is redefining work as we know it. But at least for now, and the foreseeable future, gen AI applications require human oversight—especially in the high-stakes healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors. All eyes are on the steady progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI systems that can learn, reason and adapt across domains in a human-like way. But until AGI arrives, if it ever does, gen AI can still not yet be fully trusted to navigate a complex healthcare ecosystem while ensuring safety and delivering an empathetic patient experience. Even with AGI, which might automate narrow diagnostic and quantitative tasks to assist providers, a shift in ultimate accountability for patient outcomes is unlikely. There are also important, complex questions to be answered around ethical boundaries, regulations and controls. Staying mindful to this issue, the ineradicable human factor of all healthcare, can help companies overcome one of the biggest barriers to effective, at-scale use of gen AI-enabled tools: the willingness of people to use the solution and/or help build the ecosystem needed to maintain the tool. Another way to help ensure healthy adoption of gen AI tools is to co-create the solution with members of the user group. This ensures that the tool's recommendations are user-friendly and not overly complex, fostering trust as users become acquainted with the technology. As we find ways to use generative AI to help us work more efficiently and effectively, it has become clear that this technology will transform the biopharma sector. The writing is on the wall and has been for some time. Long before Amgen made its big bet with NVIDIA, there was Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan’s declaration that the Swiss drugmaker should reimagine itself as a “medicines and data science” company. For its part, Sanofi described itself as “all in” on AI and data science when rolling out its plai app. These industry leaders are infusing their organizations with new capabilities driven by data and AI to realize tangible competitive advantage right now. Those that lag behind on generative AI risk more than a missed competitive opportunity. They risk watching an entire industry evolve without them. Want more insights from the author?

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. April 05, 2024 As companies make their way up the generative AI learning curve, we offer guidance for executing a strategy that delivers real value. Generative AI had quite a year in 2023—and so did the enterprises learning to adopt it. Companies are slowly but surely making progress on the generative AI learning curve. They’re assembling use case libraries, identifying strategic partners, strengthening the data foundation and defining policies and controls. Chief data officers everywhere are thrilled. Now, though, it’s time to move generative AI from proof of concept to production. Here are a few ways to ensure you can successfully execute on your gen AI strategy. The noise level over generative AI ideas has been deafening (think replacement of marketing or accounting). To quiet things down, businesses should align leaders’ expectations around corporate goals. Weed out use cases that are too expensive to scale or get into production. Instead, double-down on efforts that advance your company’s business objectives. The key is to move generative AI ​from theory to practice by articulating the outcomes it’s driving, such as growth, brand value, operational efficiency or improved risk and compliance. If productivity is an integral part of your company’s growth strategy, then prioritize generative AI-driven applications that boost employee output. Leadership plays a pivotal role in motivating and ensuring alignment. Some businesses establish dedicated C-suite posts for AI. Others designate chief people officers to serve as champions. One large company has formed an advisory council of senior leaders who ensure each business function embraces generative AI. By checking the pulse of generative AI within each department, the board hopes to both gain insight into AI’s impact on business functions and defuse workplace unease about the technology. Organizational change management professionals can play an important role here, complementing the work of internal councils by helping businesses quell workforce fears. Generative AI-related risk remains top-of-mind for organizations. And for good reason: Security and data access, for example, or inaccurate outcomes are legitimate concerns, as are intellectual property and copyright violations, particularly in industries such as media and entertainment. The smart strategic move, however, is to keep advancing pilots and proofs of concept, and then mitigate risk as you go.

Instead of letting ethics and compliance concerns hold back your organization, use them to strengthen your policies and governance. We’re beginning to see a greater interest in guardrails as companies forge ahead in their generative AI efforts. When Google introduced its multimodal AI model Gemini in December 2023, CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized the need to build safeguards and collaborate with governments to address risks. Earlier in 2023, Google introduced Google-Extended, a tool that lets websites and content creators appear in Google searches and opt out of their content being scraped for LLM training by tools like Bard. The upshot? Trust and safety can be part of the discussion while generative AI continues to find its way into the enterprise. Generative AI’s move into the mainstream has brought with it plenty of fear of missing out. Enterprises worry about rivals’ use of LLMs. Employees question generative AI’s impact on their jobs. More than one-third of professionals are anxious about falling behind on AI at work, and rank-and-file workers aren’t the only ones concerned about their future: 49% of CEOs surveyed say most or all of their jobs should be completely automated or replaced by AI. Tackling generative AI FOMO from the bottom up is critical. Our own research reveals 90% of jobs could experience some disruption over the next 10 years. Conducting open, productive assessments is a key task for companies. Forward-thinking organizations are encouraging employees to enrich their job profiles by assessing which skill sets are core to their jobs and which can benefit from AI-driven efficiencies. Tech businesses get the lion’s share of attention when it comes to AI. But plenty of industry-specific vendors are also making waves. Our recommendation is to track the players in your industry as well as the tech giants. Companies garnering investors’ attention for niche AI applications range from Jasper for marketing and Biomatter for health and sustainable manufacturing applications, to PerplexityAI in search. Don’t miss the small players in your industry. They might just become the leaders. To learn more, read our report, “New work, new world” on the economics of generative AI.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. May 18, 2023 Businesses need to start thinking about how generative AI may change how a range of creative and white-collar work gets done. Technology advances have always brought change to the workforce. Don’t take our word for it; ask your local farrier. What makes generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) different is that the jobs it will impact are less of the laborer type and more from the creative and white-collar professions. Now, it’s writers, coders, artists and generally anyone who generates net-new content who are looking over their shoulders. What will ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, Google Bard, DALL-E-2, OpenAI Codex and their offspring do for—and to—the skills required in tomorrow’s workplace? According to one study, nearly 60% of top executives plan to increase their use of AI and automation, with one-third redesigning work to reduce their reliance on human workers. But many experts say generative AI’s true strength “lies in augmenting—rather than replacing—the work of employees.” To take just one example, a recent paper found that gen AI improved new customer service reps’ productivity 14%. We wondered what strategies employers should use to ensure employees can best leverage the new tools. Automation is old news in the workplace, points out Duncan Roberts, thought leader and futurist at Cognizant. It’s just that until fairly recently, “it’s mostly been about eliminating repetitive tasks. Data entry, for example, is already gone” as a marketable skill. Now it’s about roles and functions traditionally viewed as more creative. Generative AI is to a writer as a calculator is to a mathematician, Roberts says: “Learning to use it will only make you more powerful.” But that learning is mandatory for those looking to remain viable. “ChatGPT isn’t going to take your job,” Roberts says. “But somebody who knows how to use it might.” For those in creative professions, generative AI will increasingly be used to facilitate some rudimentary tasks such as “very basic copywriting,” Roberts says. But when it comes to writing that requires nuance and subtlety, he sees ChatGPT, Google’s Bard and similar software as assistants, not replacements. The same goes for the rapidly expanding set of tools in the visual arts. Moreover, even as generative AI replaces some jobs, it will give rise to others. Roberts mentions prompt engineers, who specialize in ensuring AI-generated text prompts are accurate and relevant, as one. Moderating AI-generated content is another, as is training employees to use generative AI efficiently and effectively. At the same time, businesses—and society at large—must also consider the impact of generative AI on creativity, generally. “The rise of mediocrity is worrisome,” he notes, in a world in which more and more content is created in the flat, personality-free tone of the ChatGPTs and Bards. In particular, he says, young people entering the workforce must learn deeper communication skills than generative AI can offer. “Sure, it’s a floor,” Roberts says. “But it’s also a ceiling.” Understand the transformative impact of emerging technologies on the world around us as they address our most significant global challenges. editorialboard@cognizant.com Follow us Sign up for the Cognizant newsletter to gain actionable AI advice and real-world business insights delivered to your inbox every month. ©2025 Cognizant, all rights reserved",https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/insights/insights-blog/get-ready-for-the-gen-ai-skills-shuffle-wf1833251

Cognizant’s extensive software product services and accelerator foundations provide faster time to market, superior user experiences, and continuous evolution of your product. Our solutions include: For years, Cognizant has been developing automotive software solutions for connected vehicles.

Cognizant Mobility provides architectural development, testing and integration for electric vehicles, inductive charging systems and back-end solutions. In our mission to make a substantial contribution to sustainability, we leverage our knowledge and experience in automotive and system development to provide solutions to the current challenges of e-mobility.

Together with Cognizant, electric vehicle (EV) and battery manufacturers can accelerate time to market while utilities and charging station providers can better manage volatility in EV demand. Complete Vehicle E/E Development The future of modern automotive development is in electrical and electronic components. We handle all aspects of vehicle development—from car body, chassis and drive electronic system development to comprehensive development and integration of electric drive systems. Our specialties deliver positive outcomes in mobility, safety, comfort and functionality. Starting with an agile mindset, we use benchmarking, E/E architecture development and system integration to achieve complete vehicle development at the highest level.  Among our services are: We help automate and run automakers’ business operations, including finance and accounting, customer care and logistics management functions.

They provide a 360-degree view of your organization’s security ecosystem and holistically safeguard operations, factory floor and supply chain processes.

Our team of auto and security experts works constantly on solutions designed to ensure the security of vehicles and to protect against threats to electronic subsystems and parts. Based on the experience of our security experts and best practices, Cognizant’s services include the following: Hardware-Based Security The importance of hardware-based security increases dramatically due to today’s highly automated driving systems. Automakers who do not protect their control units cryptographically are putting themselves and their customers at risk.

Cognizant Mobility helps large companies meet the requirements necessary to deploy DevOps successfully. Using tools and best practices developed over time, our DevOps specialists leverage Cognizant Mobility, the cloud and our DevOps dashboard to break down applications into service modules.

OUR WORK WITH WEF As a World Economic Forum Strategic Partner, we bring our expertise and insight to guide decision-making on complex global issues like tech advancements, education and access to healthcare. February 08, 2024 Even as pressure mounts to leverage generative AI, businesses must factor in an increasingly strict regulatory environment. The insatiable appetite of generative AI models for data, including personally identifiable information, has added urgency to the ongoing debate about privacy in a hyper-technological age. You needn’t look far to learn plenty about both the risks and the steps various parties are taking to address them. This column notes a US Federal Trade Commission complaint against Rite-Aid, a drugstore chain whose “reckless use of [AI-fueled] facial surveillance systems left its customers facing humiliation and other harms,” according to an FTC official. More commonly, businesses are taking fire for their poor data privacy practices. In this rapidly changing environment that seems to feature new regulations weekly, even businesses with the best intentions may run afoul of laws—not to mention lawmakers. And the explosive growth of AI in general, and generative AI especially, is not simplifying matters. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is considered the world’s gold standard for privacy regulation; it provides extensive protections and imposes strict obligations on data controllers and processors. China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) is often compared to the GDPR. The US lacks a federal counterpart to the GDPR (though pressure is mounting to enact one), but there are privacy laws in specific areas such as healthcare and the protection of minors. California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is the most robust state privacy law (of 13, but that number is growing rapidly). Today, few nations lack some sort of personal information protection law. Business leaders may understandably feel whipsawed by rapidly changing and multiplying regulations, the constant threat of embarrassing gaffes and the pressure to do something, anything, to leverage AI. Move quickly but prudently, the advice goes. Easy for you to say. The global landscape of AI and data privacy is “a complex tapestry woven with evolving legal frameworks, technological advancements and ethical considerations,” says Tahir Latif, Cognizant’s Global Practice Lead for Data Privacy and Responsible AI. While the GDPR and the CCPA have set rigorous standards, “it's the fines and their implications that capture the attention of businesses.” An example is WhatsApp’s $244 million penalty for a 2021 GDPR violation, which serves as a stark reminder of the stakes involved. The evolving legal landscape signals an unmistakable shift toward more stringent data privacy norms, Latif says, underscoring a growing global consensus on the importance of safeguarding personal data. 

Ethical deployment brings different challenges to different industries, Latif says. “In healthcare, AI's potential in diagnostics must be balanced against privacy concerns, underscoring the need for robust anonymization techniques and ethical guidelines.” Meanwhile, the financial sector grapples with balancing AI-driven personalization against customers' rights to data privacy and explanation as mandated by privacy laws. Latif points to that industry’s embrace of such privacy-enhancing technologies as homomorphic encryption as evidence of innovative approaches being explored to reconcile these challenges—and stay on the right side of regulations. 

Good governance is often cited as the proactive key to regulatory compliance, and Latif notes the growing prominence of the US National Institute for Standards and Technology’s AI Risk Management Framework and similar data privacy guideposts. “Such frameworks are vital for managing AI risks and ensuring AI systems are not only compliant but also ethically sound,” he says. They reflect “a deeper understanding of the complexities involved and the need for comprehensive strategies that go beyond mere compliance.” 

Little about the near- to middle-term outlook is certain, Latif notes—but continuing evolution is a sure bet. “Emerging technologies like quantum computing will further redefine the landscape,” he says. “And the ongoing global dialog on data privacy and AI laws will continue to shape organizational strategies.” Such a dynamic environment presents a unique opportunity for organizations to not merely adapt but lead in the development of responsible and ethical AI practices, Latif believes. “The focus should be on harnessing AI’s potential responsibly and ensuring technological advancements align with the protection of individual rights and societal values.” Understand the transformative impact of emerging technologies on the world around us as they address our most significant global challenges. editorialboard@cognizant.com Follow us To learn more, visit the Data & AI section of our website.

A year has passed since generative AI exploded into the public conversation. For businesses, it was clear from the outset that generative AI could “change everything” about the modern enterprise landscape. Less clear, at least initially, was what that change would look like, let alone what practical steps a business should take, and in what order, to begin its gen AI journey. While some of those blanks have been filled in, uncertainty remains. In our recent survey of senior business and technology executives in the US and UK, 99% are enthusiastic about this new technology, with 61% predicting a complete transformation of their business. But fewer than half (46%) said their organizations have managed to develop robust value propositions around generative AI, and a whopping 75% say their company is “stuck” when it comes to next steps in generative AI deployment. What’s the problem? The specifics vary, but in my work with clients this year, I’ve found that the revolutionary features of gen AI are less of a sticking point than the challenge of integrating the technology with their existing business processes and technologies. Many also get bogged down with addressing gen AI integration as a technical problem, neglecting a deeper, vital question about this new technology, namely: What is generative AI for? The clear answer in my conversations with clients across industries: Generative AI is a tool for unlocking and expanding value. Properly understood, this concept not only answers many of those shorter-term questions about integration but can also lead the way to truly radical gains and growth. Before looking at radical gains, businesses should start by unlocking value trapped within their existing business processes. To identify use cases where you can run your business more efficiently, make a list of your business’s manual processes and add in areas of known inefficiency. In many cases, generative AI could probably help tackle most of these items, by automating manual processes and further streamlining processes that are already automated (including those automated by “traditional” AI). The impact: immediate cost savings, shorter value chains that speed time to market, a better customer experience and a healthy boost to the bottom line. Most businesses are already beginning to do this in pockets. In our survey, 77% of executives said their organization has begun integrating gen AI into the recruiting process—to analyze applications and screen applicants. Around 80% are using the technology in customer service, while fully 90% are confident that gen AI will enhance the power and efficiency of their marketing strategies. But savings and efficiencies are just the beginning of what generative AI has to offer. Businesses can also mine this powerful technology for much deeper, richer streams of value. These can be found among the business’s data assets—data that has been generated or acquired by existing processes but has not yet been used or monetized. Think of these assets as the exhaust of your current operations that could expand value when applied to different markets or a different business model. Customer data is a prime example. Many organizations are sitting on reams of customer information that generative AI could use to design personalized product offerings or package in such a way that it could be monetized to advertisers. It gets better. Gen AI systems can do more than find value in existing data sets. They can also gather and integrate pools of unstructured data that may, today, be stranded in isolated systems, platforms and departments across a business. As a general principle, the more disparate and far-flung these “data silos” are today, the more novel and valuable the insights they could yield once they’re consolidated. And don’t be constrained by a narrow conception of “data.” We’re working with a biopharmaceutical company to develop generative AI-powered portals to give doctors and patients greater visibility into the company’s treatment options. This data could be leveraged, through gen AI, to enhance the user experience, shrink the value chain and speed time to value. If this were all, it would be a lot. The bottom-line benefits of more efficient operations—coupled with the value gen AI can unlock within existing business models—will confer a huge competitive advantage on those companies that take a proactive but responsible approach to this new technology. But for a lucky few, perhaps a lucky many, gen AI will not only generate savings and new revenue streams within existing business models but will also help create new business models and market opportunities from scratch. Consider the case of Amazon Web Services. Amazon.com, you may remember, started life as an online bookseller. As the business expanded into general e-commerce, Amazon built a sturdy IT infrastructure to handle its increasingly vast online operations. Rather than hoard this technology, Amazon in 2006 launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), a standalone cloud-computing service that countless companies, from startups to Fortune 500 companies, now license to support their own operations. That AWS today accounts for “only” 16% of Amazon’s total revenue is a testament to the persistent health of its e-commerce business. AWS’s own revenues, however—a cool $80 billion in 2022—make it a behemoth by any objective measure. While Amazon built and launched AWS without the help of gen AI, the pattern it represents—that of a business model born, incubated and launched within the structure of an existing and very different business model—will be much more common in the age of generative AI. The unlocking of value, at every level of a business from the micro to the macro, will create a fertile ground for innovation and make such “happy accidents” all but inevitable. Start small with gen AI. Before any wholesale commitment can take place, there is groundwork to be laid: reskilling workers, restructuring management and, perhaps most important, “replumbing” data pipelines and IT architectures for gen AI integration. Outside consultants can bring tremendous value here, as they can help with the subsequent work of building and/or fine-tuning a large language model. Consultants may also be able to immediately identify the first-order inefficiencies and potential savings that existing gen AI tools can unlock without major capital investment. By steering a course toward this North Star, you’ll find the road will be much clearer, less daunting and radically shorter to realizing significant gains in value from generative AI.

TechMahindra,Tech Mahindra and AWS to Transform Telecom Networks with GenAI,"Scale at Speed™ Building India’s own large language model Digital home ownership experience for a large bank in Canada Bespoke Loan Origination System for a Bank in Indonesia Tech Mahindra Launches agentX, a Comprehensive Suite of GenAI Solutions to Drive Efficiency for Enterprises Globally Tech Mahindra and AWS Collaborate to Transform Telecom Networks with Generative AI Ways of Working Performance Assurance for Tier-1 Telematics Customer in North America Popular Searches Main navigation (Mobile) Tech Mahindra (NSE: TECHM), a leading global provider of technology consulting and digital solutions to enterprises across industries, has signed a multi-year Strategic Collaboration Agreement (SCA) with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to develop an Autonomous Networks Operations Platform (ANOP) designed for Communication Service Providers (CSPs) and enterprise customers. This platform by Tech Mahindra is built on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and generative AI (GenAI) services powered by AWS, enabling customers to transition their network operations from an on-premises infrastructure to a real-time proactive and preventive model operating on a hybrid cloud. The collaboration combines Tech Mahindra’s GenAI capabilities and telecom networks expertise with Amazon SageMaker, a service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models for any industry use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows. The ANOP platform empowers CSPs to enhance Network Operations Center (NOC) productivity for teams managing physical and cloud infrastructure by more than 50%. It reduces field visits by over 15% and shortens Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) for network and service incidents by more than 30%. The platform accelerates the implementation of network and service configurations, achieving improvements of over 30% in speed and efficiency. Additionally, the collaboration includes Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service providing high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI enterprises via a single API. It offers essential capabilities for building GenAI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI practices. Manish Mangal, Chief Technology Officer, Telecom & Global Business Head, Network Services at Tech Mahindra, said, ""The communications industry is at a pivotal junction of deploying disaggregated, virtualized and cloud-native RAN networks. Our collaboration with AWS empowers telcos to simplify operations, modernize networks, and unlock revenue through advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning. By integrating AWS’s GenAI, our Autonomous Networks Operations Platform delivers real-time insights, intelligent workflows, and supports O-RAN adoption for efficient, proactive network management.” Tech Mahindra is also testing and validating O-RAN functions on Amazon's EKS Anywhere (EKS-A) platform. The joint testing and validation of the platform for Distributed Unit and Central Unit network functions will accelerate the cloudification of RAN at the edge, thereby leveraging the power of both organizations for wider industry benefits. Robin Harwani, Head of Telco Industry Solutions at AWS, said, “The collaboration to integrate AWS’s AI/ML, including generative AI offerings to build Tech Mahindra’s Autonomous Networks Operations Platform, is an important step to help telco operators bring acceleration in their network operations transformation. Through this effort, network operators can get generative AI-enabled actionable and just-in-time recommendations such as for NOC operations, field dispatch optimization, as well as automated self-healing for preventive actions. This will make it easier for operators to more proactively manage and optimize network performance and reduce their operational expenditure.""

The study underscores the transformative potential of GenAI for businesses and offers key insights on how enterprises can shift from a visionary “dreamer” mindset to a practical, implementation-focused “doer” mindset. The survey-based study, including a series of intensive interviews, of 260 enterprise leaders with GenAI experience across North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Asia-Pacific  tells us the time to hold back on GenAI initiatives is over. Every leader surveyed stated GenAI would be deployed within their IT programs within the next 12-18 months and that its application will be widespread, with 39% saying it will be in more than half of their IT programs in the same timeframe. The report emphasizes that adopting a proactive ""doer"" mindset can propel enterprises beyond proof-of-concept (POC) stages and pilot projects, enabling full operational deployment of GenAI. Compared to those still in planning stages, enterprises embracing this approach are five times more likely to achieve functional GenAI deployment, showcasing tangible benefits of practical strategies. Furthermore, the report urges enterprise leaders to grasp GenAI's substantial potential while managing associated risks, costs, and compliance considerations. It stresses the urgency of proactive engagement in a rapidly evolving technological landscape, reinforcing the message: ""Stop dreaming, start doing."" Mohit Joshi, CEO and Managing Director, Tech Mahindra, ""GenAI is transforming businesses by automating tasks, enhancing content creation, and boosting productivity. At Tech Mahindra, we exemplify how integrating GenAI into core operations drives profound outcomes and fosters innovation to scale at speed. This report underscores the strategic imperative for businesses to embrace GenAI and unlock limitless possibilities.” According to the study’s author, David Cushman, Executive Research Leader at HFS Research, “New technologies such as GenAI take us into the territory of unknown unknowns. Best practices have yet to be discovered, let alone established. The best way through such uncertainty is to get on and try things – and learn from doing. This research is a ringing endorsement for that approach.” HFS Research CEO and Chief Analyst Phil Fersht, agrees, ""GenAI represents a seismic technological shift, offering unparalleled capabilities to transform business operations. The era of maintaining outdated processes and technologies is over. The choice is clear: innovate or be left behind.""

TechMahindra,Data-Driven Decisions-Tech Mahindra's Visualization-as-a-Service,"Scale at Speed™ Building India’s own large language model Digital home ownership experience for a large bank in Canada Bespoke Loan Origination System for a Bank in Indonesia Tech Mahindra Launches agentX, a Comprehensive Suite of GenAI Solutions to Drive Efficiency for Enterprises Globally Tech Mahindra and AWS Collaborate to Transform Telecom Networks with Generative AI Ways of Working Performance Assurance for Tier-1 Telematics Customer in North America Popular Searches Main navigation (Mobile) We are all familiar with the fable of the five blindfolded men describing an elephant. Irrespective of which version of the story you have heard, the crux always remains the same. Five blindfolded men were asked to describe an elephant just by touching it. Since their sight was limited, they described the elephant based on the certain body parts they touched. They claimed the elephant to be a rope, wall, fan, pillar, and plow-shaped animal. This parable underscores the importance of context and the limitations of perception. What if we tell you many business executives face similar issues when making data-driven, contextual business decisions? Many businesses lack effective data visualization tools that can help them contextualize and interpret vast amounts of enterprise data meaningfully and make necessary business decisions. As a result, it leads to more chaos rather than clarity. Even when businesses have the means to visualize their data, the visuals are not coherent or easily understandable, delaying crucial business decisions. Due to fewer industry-standard data models, key performance indicators (KPIs), and persistent dataset gaps, many businesses require assistance creating standard templates. Data lineage and relationships between datasets can be difficult to establish and maintain without proper guidance and support. All these lead to a chaotic environment where businesses struggle to use their enterprise data without easy and comprehensible visualization. To help businesses transform cluttered data into clear, actionable insights, Tech Mahindra has developed a Visualization-as-a-Service (VaaS) framework on top of the Microsoft Azure platform. The VaaS framework creates a unified schematic model in Microsoft Power BI on the Microsoft Intelligent Data platform that integrates data across systems. On top of this foundational layer, VaaS brings in industry-standard KPIs, process-oriented data models, and predefined report templates to tie different business use cases to the model and semantic layer. This expedites the development of intuitive dashboards and visuals that offer insights on the fly. Adapting the various industry standards brings high-performance, cost-effective, and business-friendly dashboards. These future-ready dashboards, embedded with GenAI capabilities, can catapult organizations on their data-driven insights journey. VaaS also provides data lineage and relationships that help to produce complete source mapping that aids in root cause and impact analysis. VaaS, is part of Tech Mahindra's D.A.H.L.I.A Platform (Data Analytics Hub for Large Scale Insights Acceleration), which has multiple Gen AI embedded Data Analytics solution accelerators across data value chain, right from Data Ingestion to Consumption layer that helps to expedite Organization’s journey towards Data Driven Ingestion. VaaS brings in transformational services that help audit and assess the data visualization landscape, to identify and recommend various ways to organize and clean the reporting environment by highlighting similar reports that can be merged along with complete metadata-driven data lineage service, that helps to map the data elements present in the reports to the source system, which in turn enables to perform the root cause and impact analysis for any change management required in the future. Its pre-built industry-standard KPIs, process-oriented data models, and standard report templates accelerate and standardize the visual layer, effectively aiding in providing intuitive and cross-functional actionable insights. VaaS infuses GenAI capabilities that enable self-serve BI and ensures that businesses can have all the required insights by interacting with natural language and leaving everything else on the VaaS framework to deliver the insights traversing through all the technical and business metadata. In short, it enhances the ease of access, democratizes insights, and helps organizations to become data-driven. Watch Now to Learn more. As crucial as data is to businesses, visualizing it plays a more significant role. Proper visualization of your organizational data makes charting the current data landscape easier. Together with Microsoft, Tech Mahindra is committed to the smooth digitalization of enterprises. Effective data visualization is a core part of these digitalization projects.

TechMahindra,The AI aXis: Realizing the Full Potential of Generative AI with agentX,"Scale at Speed™ Building India’s own large language model Digital home ownership experience for a large bank in Canada Bespoke Loan Origination System for a Bank in Indonesia Tech Mahindra Launches agentX, a Comprehensive Suite of GenAI Solutions to Drive Efficiency for Enterprises Globally Tech Mahindra and AWS Collaborate to Transform Telecom Networks with Generative AI Ways of Working Performance Assurance for Tier-1 Telematics Customer in North America Popular Searches Main navigation (Mobile) As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to reshape industries, businesses are at a critical juncture. Yet, realizing its full potential requires more than just implementing AI—it demands a strategic ecosystem that aligns people, processes, and tools. In my previous post, I highlighted the promise of Tech Mahindra's agentX, which enhances user productivity by automating repetitive tasks and achieving productivity gains of up to 70% (AI Magazine, 2024). Today, we will take a closer look at how businesses can harness the promise of agentX by exploring the necessary ecosystem for its success. Generative AI (GenAI) is more than a tool or a technology; instead, it is a transformative force that could revolutionize industries and unlock untapped opportunities. However, the true power of GenAI lies not in the technology itself but in the broader ecosystem, supported by three critical levers: people, processes, and tools. Together, these elements form the AI aXis. Before we explore the components of the AI aXis, let's consider an analogy. Imagine you purchased a Ferrari, a car that promises to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in under five seconds. Exciting, right? But what happens if the driver is only trained to drive a Fiat, and the road is riddled with potholes? Can Ferrari still deliver on its promise? Likely not. GenAI is your Ferrari—a powerful tool with extraordinary potential. But to unlock its capabilities, you need to focus on the three critical elements of the AI aXis: the driver (people), the road (processes), and the engine (tools). Each of these elements is indispensable. Without skilled drivers, smooth roads, and a powerful engine, even a Ferrari won't perform. The same holds true for GenAI—its success relies on aligning people, processes, and tools to achieve seamless integration and transformative outcomes. This is where agentX, Tech Mahindra's GenAI-powered suite, steps in as a key enabler of the AI aXis. Before embarking on their GenAI journey, organizations need a clear AI blueprint—a comprehensive roadmap that guides every step of the transformation. This blueprint helps to ensure that all AI initiatives are aligned and working toward the same strategic objectives. Without a robust AI blueprint, organizations risk fragmented efforts, where isolated AI projects lack the cohesion to deliver meaningful results. An AI blueprint is not static; it should evolve over time and must be updated regularly to reflect changing business priorities. It defines the organization's AI strategy, focus areas, and alignment with long-term goals. It also lays the foundation for how people, processes, and tools will work together to create a cohesive and efficient AI aXis. Many organizations experiment with isolated AI tools or implement solutions without a proper blueprint, which can lead to a lack of meaningful and sustainable outcomes. No matter how advanced the technology is, its potential remains untapped without a workforce that can use it effectively. People are the drivers of GenAI and must be equipped with the skills, mindset, and confidence to work alongside AI systems effectively. Leadership is crucial in driving this transformation. By prioritizing upskilling and reskilling, businesses can ensure their workforce is equipped to engage with AI tools, interpret insights, and collaborate seamlessly with these systems. Beyond technical training, there needs to be a cultural shift where employees view AI as a valuable enabler. A well-trained and confident workforce is the cornerstone of the AI aXis, ensuring that GenAI delivers its full potential. Many organizations make the mistake of embedding AI into existing workflows without reimagining them. This strategy is similar to patching potholes instead of building a new road. To fully unlock AI's potential, business processes must be redesigned from the ground up to align with AI capabilities and organizational goals. Additionally, these business processes must be agile enough to adapt to the rapid evolution of AI technologies. Establishing cross-functional workflows is necessary to eliminate silos and enable seamless collaboration. Organizations must reimagine business processes and embrace agility to drive efficiency and innovation at scale. Legacy tools, built for pre-AI environments, often need more scalability and flexibility to meet today's demands. This is where 'AI-first tools' come in. These are tools specifically designed for AI environments, with features that enable scalability, adaptability, and seamless integration. To unlock the full potential of GenAI, organizations must invest in these tools. Think of these tools as the engine of the Ferrari. Without a powerful, purpose-built engine, even the smoothest road and the most skilled driver will struggle to deliver results. AI-first tools provide the foundation for automating processes, extracting insights, and scaling innovation across the enterprise. While the AI aXis framework—comprising people, processes, and tools—is essential for GenAI's success, organizations must address foundational challenges to unlock its full potential. These include ensuring data readiness, as high-quality, well-governed data is vital for AI systems. It also involves addressing ethical concerns such as bias, transparency, and privacy, alongside managing resistance to change through effective adoption strategies. Acknowledging and addressing these challenges is key to creating a sustainable AI ecosystem that delivers meaningful results. When the three elements of the AI aXis—people, processes, and tools—are aligned, the full potential of GenAI can be realized. They transform GenAI from being merely a high-performance vehicle on a rough road with an untrained driver into a powerful machine that achieves outstanding results. People provide the creativity and competence to engage with AI effectively. Processes create the structure and efficiency to maximize AI's impact. Tools deliver the power and scalability to turn vision into results. Together, these elements form a unified AI aXis that drives success. This is where agentX plays a pivotal role.

The future of mobility is rapidly approaching, with Generative AI (GenAI) playing a leading role in this evolution. From self-driving cars to personalized transportation, GenAI is becoming an essential capability, driving innovation across the entire mobility ecosystem. This article explores why GenAI is crucial for the automotive industry, how businesses are leveraging it today, and how the future of mobility will be shaped by GenAI-driven advancements. Generative AI (GenAI) applications are based on underlying foundation models. These models consist of large artificial neural networks, which are computer algorithms inspired by the neurons in the human brain. GenAI applications can perform a variety of tasks, such as natural language processing, answering questions, and creating new content like images, videos, and audio. The short answer is yes. Automotive businesses are adopting GenAI technology in two key areas: inside vehicles (enhancing driving and safety) and inside business processes (optimizing operations and customer service). Here are some examples of GenAI being used inside vehicles: In terms of business processes, here are some examples: What Is the Future Direction of GenAI in the Automotive Industry? According to a survey by McKinsey & Company (2023)6, key GenAI use cases span four areas: In the automotive sector, we expect GenAI to impact customer support, after-sales services, and technical assistance by promoting customer self-service and enhancing agent productivity. In marketing and sales, GenAI will likely create personalized content, recommend vehicles based on customer search history, and automate customer interaction scripts for sales representatives. In software engineering, GenAI will be pivotal in developing software-defined vehicles, especially in embedded vehicle programming. In R&D, as seen with Toyota, GenAI will revolutionize the generation of initial vehicle concept images based on design constraints, accelerating the creative phase of product development.

TechMahindra,Moving Past the GenAI Honeymoon Phase: Key Factors to Consider for Scaling Adoption,"Scale at Speed™ Building India’s own large language model Digital home ownership experience for a large bank in Canada Bespoke Loan Origination System for a Bank in Indonesia Tech Mahindra Launches agentX, a Comprehensive Suite of GenAI Solutions to Drive Efficiency for Enterprises Globally Tech Mahindra and AWS Collaborate to Transform Telecom Networks with Generative AI Ways of Working Performance Assurance for Tier-1 Telematics Customer in North America Popular Searches Main navigation (Mobile) Generative AI (GenAI) has captured the imagination of industries across the globe. Its ability to create content, solve complex problems through self-learning algorithms, and present endless possible use cases has brought excitement among businesses and consumers alike. However, as organizations move beyond the initial ""honeymoon phase"" of experimentation and early adoption, scaling GenAI in a way that delivers sustained value requires thoughtful planning, strategy, robust implementation framework, and determination. This is precisely why only 11% of the companies have adopted GenAI at scale. To fully unlock the potential of GenAI at scale, enterprises need to consider several key factors that go beyond early experimentation by establishing foundations for scalable technology and rethinking operational workflows. From managing expectations to addressing data governance, security, and workforce readiness, let’s explore the core considerations for organizations aiming to elevate their GenAI efforts. Defining an AI Strategy Aligned with Business Objectives Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to be a powerful tool for increasing productivity, enhancing efficiency, and driving innovation provided it aligns with the organization's business objectives. Today, many GenAI applications and use cases are fragmented, often addressing isolated problems with minimal impact if implemented in silos. Therefore, it becomes essential for CXOs to define a comprehensive AI roadmap with the following considerations in mind: Only this level of planned innovation can lead to measurable outcomes, such as reduced costs, improved productivity, and increased customer satisfaction or operational efficiency. Monitoring, Analyzing, and Iterating Given the cost and time involved in developing and implementing AI into day-to-day operations, organizations must continually monitor, analyze, and iterate to ensure a positive return on investment (ROI). CXOs need to monitor the collection of accurate, high-quality, and diverse datasets since they influence the overall accuracy and reliability of the GenAI models. The data needs to be analyzed using the correct algorithms to generate the necessary outcomes and make adjustments required to improve efficiency and accuracy. Operationalizing AI with Scalable Tools and Platforms AI is no longer native to new-age companies, organizations across different sectors are operationalizing AI to achieve business objectives. For enterprises across sectors to improve and maximize business values using AI, it is necessary to operationalize it at scale. However, it is easier said than done, as deploying a few AI models is far simpler than running an entire organization powered by AI. Organizations that are committed to AI adoption need to adopt Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), a newer discipline through which we can establish the necessary ecosystem to facilitate the rapid, safe, and efficient development of GenAI models. MLOps also ensures that the AI models are continuously monitored, updated, and maintained using data pipelines, performance tracking, and lifecycle management, leveraging scalable AI platforms provided by various cloud service providers (CSPs). Building a Strong Data Infrastructure and Governance Framework Data is the fuel that powers all AI systems. Reliable and diverse data improves the learning process, helping AI models to understand the various tasks at hand. As organizations try to scale AI adoption, they are impacted either by the diversity of the available data set or the lack of the necessary infrastructure to store, develop, and implement the models. This is because ensuring data accessibility and security is crucial for GenAI models to perform efficiently. While scaling the GenAI adoption enterprises need to ensure the necessary governance framework, policies, and controls are in place to ensure the quality, integrity, and security of the data throughout its lifecycle. Governance protocols should be set up to protect sensitive information, enforce ethical usage, and meet compliance requirements. Ethical Considerations and Responsible AI While implementing GenAI is crucial for business success, organizations must consider safety to build trust among users, since GenAI models rely on data collected from its users to improve accuracy. Organizations must clarify data ownership, storage, and usage of the data. They also should enforce transparent policies regarding data sharing, storage, and utilization to foster trustworthiness, ensure ethical consideration, and promote responsible use of AI. Cross-functional Collaboration and Workforce Transformation Given the complexity of scaling GenAI models, it needs collaboration among multiple teams and departments within an organization to prevent AI initiatives from being developed in silos and to encourage constant feedback from all stakeholders. Leaders need to define the AI strategy and technical teams need to clearly explain the capabilities and limitations of AI across the organization for easier implementation and adaptation. Organizations need to invest in developing and upskilling resources, enriching them with the latest developments in the field of AI to avoid major roadblocks in adaptation. Organizations must ensure that employees clearly understand the application of GenAI in automating routine processes. Further, AI adoption should be demonstrated and democratized across all functions within the organization to ensure adaptability. As organizations transition from the initial enthusiasm surrounding GenAI to long-term implementation, organizations need to focus on building sustainable GenAI practices that drive meaningful impact. Successful scaling of GenAI models is not about just deploying these models at scale but also ensuring that these developments align with the overall business objectives. Ultimately, a well-defined strategy will enhance operational efficiency, and support innovation and growth in an increasingly data-driven world.

Considering the rate of progress, the possibilities are breathtakingly vast. The increasing use of GenAI in professional and public spaces alike raises a fundamental question: How do we ensure that the pace of development for GenAI doesn't undermine trust and safety? A recent McKinsey survey says 63 percent of organizations view the implementation of GenAI as a high priority. However, 91 percent said they were unprepared to manage the accompanying risks. The gap between ambition and preparedness emphasizes the critical imperative of responsible AI development and adoption. But that doesn’t mean GenAI advancements will stop. A recent Gartner study found that 68% of respondents prefer to focus on GenAI's various benefits rather than its negative implications. We need to address GenAI technology from a balanced perspective. Let's look at some specific opportunities GenAI is unlocking. From automated content generation to customer service AI Agents, GenAI tools streamline operations, freeing precious time and enhancing productivity. GenAI can also help companies create customized user experiences for both employees and end customers by tailoring content, recommendations, and responses for services on the go. GenAI's enhanced learning capabilities also allow for accelerated product development and R&D. For instance, AMD is using GenAI to shorten the design cycle for specialized chips. Simultaneously, many companies are leveraging GenAI to offer critical AI services and models. Microsoft Azure’s OpenAI Service is a perfect example, providing companies with AI solutions that create new revenue sources and differentiate their products​. GenAI will also play a fundamental role in helping businesses achieve their environmental goals. It will allow businesses to significantly reduce their negative environmental impact through process optimization, waste reduction, and efficient resource management. However, despite these benefits, concerns loom large. A Cisco study reveals that 27% of organizations banned GenAI applications altogether, fearing data privacy and security issues. So, what are the hiccups? Responsible GenAI adoption requires addressing various trust, safety, and compliance challenges. These challenges are not merely technical hurdles; they are fundamental questions about how we want to shape the future of AI. These obstacles require thoughtful solutions to ensure that GenAI's potential is harnessed responsibly and ethically. Addressing the challenges of GenAI means embracing a multifaceted approach that involves collaboration between governments, businesses, and researchers. Here are some critical steps toward building a future where AI innovation is both transformative and responsible: By considering the abovementioned steps, we can create a future in which GenAI empowers innovation while respecting ethical boundaries and safeguarding the interests of individuals and the society at large. The potential of GenAI is undeniable, with its capacity to revolutionize industries and drive unprecedented innovation. From boosting productivity and personalizing customer experiences to accelerating product development and opening new revenue streams, GenAI is poised to transform the way we work, interact, and create. However, realizing this transformative potential requires responsible development and deployment. Moving forward, this will necessitate a strong emphasis on the following areas: Addressing the challenges related to trust, transparency, safety, data privacy, and regulatory compliance is an ethical imperative for ensuring the long-term sustainability and widespread adoption of GenAI. Only then can businesses scale their operations at speed in the era of GenAI-powered processes and drive meaningful transformation. 1.IDC Estimates that GenAI Will Increase Marketing Productivity More Than 40% by 2029.

TechMahindra,The Future of Operational Efficiency with agentX,"Scale at Speed™ Building India’s own large language model Digital home ownership experience for a large bank in Canada Bespoke Loan Origination System for a Bank in Indonesia Tech Mahindra Launches agentX, a Comprehensive Suite of GenAI Solutions to Drive Efficiency for Enterprises Globally Tech Mahindra and AWS Collaborate to Transform Telecom Networks with Generative AI Ways of Working Performance Assurance for Tier-1 Telematics Customer in North America Popular Searches Main navigation (Mobile) In my earlier post, we explored about the ‘The AI aXis’ in Realizing the Full Potential of Generative AI with agentX. In this blog, let’s dive deeper into how agentX improves operational efficiency across the enterprise ecosystem. Over the past three decades, enterprise applications have evolved from mainframes to client-server models and now Web 3.0. While these shifts have made applications scalable, reliable, and accessible, the way users interact with them has largely remained unchanged. To put things into perspective: enterprise applications are still like manual cars, sometimes, requiring significant effort and expertise to operate. But today's world demands modern cars, or in the IT world, intelligent systems that work with minimal input, saving time and effort. And yes, if it's not obvious from my earlier posts... I do love cars Despite major technological advancements, many processes remain siloed and manual, creating unnecessary bottlenecks. Users still navigate multiple interfaces, undergo training for new tools, and switch between applications to complete simple tasks. This is where agentX, particularly agentAssistX, steps in to effectively address these challenges. agentAssistX, the first solution in the agentX suite, tackles operational inefficiencies by automating workflows, eliminating redundant steps, and providing an intuitive conversational AI experience - no complex navigation required. And no, this is not just another chatbot, but that’s a story for another day. How agentAssistX addresses real-world bottlenecks: agentAssistX offers possibilities where enterprise applications no longer operate in silos but function as a unified, intelligent ecosystem. What the future looks like: Here are the measurable impacts of using agentAssistX: For a $10 billion company, these efficiencies could create $1.5–3 billion (up to 30%) in annual value. agentAssistX is a comprehensive enterprise solution with streamlined workflows that eliminate inefficiencies from business processes, ensuring smooth operations. Enhanced collaboration integrates data and workflows across departments, breaking down silos and improving teamwork. Faster decision-making is achieved as AI provides actionable insights, speeding up decision-making. Simplified user experiences allow users to interact with their conversational AI platform naturally, reducing the need for extensive training. Now some thing for nerds , agentAssistX integrates enterprise LLMs and app-specific SLMs into workflows, delivering impactful outcomes. If we consider the car analogy, then: At Tech Mahindra, we have already integrated conversational AI platforms like Copilot into our internal help desk. With conversational inputs, tasks like ticket creation, which once took 5–7 minutes, now take seconds, similar to using voice commands in a modern car. To fully leverage conversational AI with agentAssistX, enterprises must address key considerations: agentAssistX offers a practical solution for enterprises seeking to streamline operations and improve productivity. By replacing siloed applications with a unified, conversational AI ecosystem, it eliminates systemic inefficiencies, improves collaboration, and offers a superior user experience. With solutions like agentAssistX, the agentX suite ensures operational efficiency moves from aspiration to reality.

Tech Mahindra helps businesses amplify human ingenuity, creativity, and productivity with a copilot for everyone. With Tech Mahindra and Microsoft, enterprises can safeguard their business and data with the most trusted AI platform in a responsible manner. Outcome-centric governance moves away from traditional governance models, which are more about risk management and process adherence over aligning with strategy and achieving clear outcomes. Outcome-centric governance revolves around flexibility, continuous alignment with business objectives, and a focus on delivering specific, quantifiable results. This approach is essential for turning the vast potential of GenAI into real business impact. At its core, outcome-centric governance ensures that every GenAI initiative is precisely designed, executed, and evaluated based on its ability to deliver specific business outcomes. This involves several key elements, including setting clear objectives, defining relevant use cases, establishing a comprehensive governance framework, continuously monitoring performance, engaging stakeholders, and addressing ethical and legal considerations. A fundamental pillar of outcome-centric governance is setting clear objectives and prioritizing use cases. Enterprises must start by carefully defining their goals with their GenAI initiatives, identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), and outlining desired business impacts. These objectives should adhere to the SMART criteria—specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound—to ensure clarity and effectiveness. Subsequently, it is important to prioritize use cases that closely align with these strategic goals and promise significant returns on investment (ROI). Imagine a retail powerhouse aiming to boost customer engagement by 20% annually through GenAI-driven personalized recommendations. This could result in tailored email campaigns and dynamic website content, based on individual customer preferences. By focusing efforts and resources on specific, high-impact initiatives, enterprises can avoid dilution and maximize the effectiveness of GenAI implementations. A robust governance framework is important for guiding the deployment and management of GenAI initiatives. This should include flexible yet stringent guidelines outlining the scope, permissible data sources, and acceptable uses of GenAI. While flexibility drives innovation and responsiveness to new insights, preventing misuse and ensuring strict compliance with ethical standards is essential. Moreover, robust access control mechanisms are another critical component of outcome-centric governance. These mechanisms ensure that only authorized personnel can interact with GenAI systems and data, thereby safeguarding against unauthorized access and misuse. This involves a crystal-clear delineation of roles and responsibilities, implementing strict user authentication protocols, and a regular review of access permissions to maintain integrity and compliance standards. Continuous monitoring and adaptability are the cornerstones of outcome-centric governance. Enterprises must consistently track the performance of GenAI applications against defined objectives and KPIs to assess their efficacy. This involves gathering and analyzing data to determine if AI systems are producing the expected results. If performance deviates from targets, prompt corrective actions should be taken to realign the initiatives with business goals. Furthermore, the governance framework is not a rigid structure; it's a dynamic system that ensures GenAI initiatives remain relevant and effective. The governance model should have dynamic capabilities, allowing it to evolve with emerging insights, technological advancements, and changing business needs. This adaptability not only facilitates long-term success but also enables enterprises to remain agile and responsive amidst a rapidly changing landscape, instilling confidence in their ability to handle emerging challenges. Take, for instance, a financial institution leveraging GenAI for fraud detection. In this scenario, it must proactively predict and prepare for the emerging new fraud modalities. Therefore, the governance framework must include provisions for continuous updates to AI models and training data. This ensures perpetual alignment with the evolving threat landscape and sustains effectiveness and relevance. Engaging stakeholders from diverse organizational domains is not just a formality; it's a fundamental pillar of successful GenAI governance. This involves fostering collaboration and soliciting input from representatives across departments, including IT, data science, legal, compliance, and various business units. By incorporating diverse perspectives and expertise, enterprises can ensure GenAI initiatives are fully aligned with strategic objectives and foster a culture of shared ownership and collaboration. This helps each stakeholder feel valued and integral to the success of GenAI initiatives. Regular reviews with stakeholders help assess progress, address challenges and refine the governance model. These reviews should be structured yet flexible, facilitating open dialogue and collective problem-solving. By involving stakeholders in the governance process, enterprises can enhance transparency, accountability, and buy-in, promoting collaboration and shared responsibility. Integrating ethical and legal considerations is another non-negotiable aspect of outcome-centric governance. GenAI initiatives must adhere to relevant regulations and ethical standards, including data privacy laws, intellectual property rights, and industry-specific regulations. Compliance with these standards is essential for mitigating legal risks and building trust with customers and stakeholders. Promoting the ethical use of GenAI involves establishing principles prioritizing fairness, transparency, and accountability. Enterprises must proactively address potential biases in AI models, ensure alignment with organizational values, and maintain transparency in AI decision-making processes. By upholding ethical standards, enterprises can build trust, reduce reputational risks, and contribute to long-term sustainability and social responsibility. Adopting an outcome-centric approach to governance is crucial for GenAI initiatives to deliver tangible results, but it often involves overcoming various obstacles. But these can be effectively managed with the right strategies and mindset. Tech Mahindra and Microsoft AI experts help create value props, define roles, and prioritize use cases to solve customers' business problems. The team has defined principles and transparent governance structures that build trust in AI amongst all stakeholders. Managing Uncertainty The uncertainty around GenAI necessitates flexible governance frameworks for businesses that can adapt to emerging risks and opportunities. Enterprises must stay abreast of the latest advancements in AI technology and regulatory changes, to foster a culture of learning and adaptability. Continuous governance policy and practice updates empower enterprises to adeptly navigate uncertainty, fostering sustained success. Balancing Control and Innovation Striking a delicate balance between control and innovation is a key challenge in outcome-centric governance. While stringent control measures are essential for risk managements, fostering innovation requires flexibility and experimentation. Enterprises must implement guided flexibility to address this challenge, setting clear boundaries for experimentation and exploration. One effective approach is to define 'safe zones' for innovation, where GenAI initiatives can be tested with minimal risk to critical operations. For example, an enterprise could designate a particular business unit or project to pilot new AI-driven solutions before scaling them organization-wide. By confining innovation within controlled environments, enterprises can minimize potential negative impacts while fostering a culture of experimentation and creativity. Establishing rigorous testing and validation mechanisms is crucial for GenAI initiatives. Before deployment, techniques such as A/B testing, simulation environments, and sandboxing can help evaluate performance and robustness. Comprehensive testing protocols identify and mitigate potential risks early, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of the solutions. Ensuring Scalability Scalability poses another major challenge in outcome-centric governance, mainly as the use of GenAI grows within enterprises. As GenAI initiatives scale across departments, business units, and geographies, governance processes must evolve to handle increasing volumes of data, complexity, and operational demands. To address these scalability challenges, enterprises can implement centralized governance supported by scalable infrastructure and tools. Centralized governance enables enterprises to establish consistent policies, procedures, and oversight mechanisms across diverse GenAI initiatives, facilitating efficient management and compliance. Additionally, deploying scalable infrastructure, such as cloud-based platforms and distributed computing resources, enables enterprises to accommodate growing computational demands and data volumes without compromising performance or reliability. Furthermore, investing in automation and orchestration technologies can streamline governance processes and reduce administrative overhead. Automating routine tasks such as data ingestion, model training, and compliance monitoring improves efficiency, agility, and scalability while minimizing the risk of human error for enterprises. To effectively monitor and evaluate the governance of GenAI initiatives, enterprises must establish clear, specific metrics and KPIs spanning various dimensions, including cost, performance, accuracy, compliance, and ethical considerations. Effective governance requires a structured method for continuous evaluation and improvement, encompassing several vital steps: Outcome-centric governance represents a fundamental paradigm shift in the governance of GenAI initiatives, that emphasizes strategic alignment, measurable outcomes, and stakeholder engagement. As GenAI continues to reshape the business landscape, enterprises must recognize the critical importance of outcome-centric governance in ensuring the success and sustainability of their AI initiatives. By prioritizing strategic alignment, flexibility, and ethical considerations, enterprises can navigate challenges, mitigate risks, and harness GenAI's transformative power to drive long-term growth and prosperity.

TechMahindra,Harnessing AI with Speed and Purpose: Building the Generative Enterprise of the Future,"Scale at Speed™ Building India’s own large language model Digital home ownership experience for a large bank in Canada Bespoke Loan Origination System for a Bank in Indonesia Tech Mahindra Launches agentX, a Comprehensive Suite of GenAI Solutions to Drive Efficiency for Enterprises Globally Tech Mahindra and AWS Collaborate to Transform Telecom Networks with Generative AI Ways of Working Performance Assurance for Tier-1 Telematics Customer in North America Popular Searches Main navigation (Mobile) Despite its vast promise, many organizations are struggling to leverage generative AI (GenAI) to drive real outcomes. Our recent study, conducted with HFS Research, highlights a growing divide between those who dream of GenAI’s potential and those actively using it to drive transformational change. Dreamers are caught in an endless loop of proofs of concept (POCs) and pilot projects, while doers are embedding AI into their operations to create measurable value. While every enterprise in the HFS/Tech Mahindra study plans to deploy GenAI within 12-18 months, only 35% have advanced beyond theoretical models to deliver real, measurable impact. Over the past decade, enterprises have embraced the digital revolution, leveraging cloud computing, data-driven insights, and automation to enhance efficiency and foster innovation. However, the generative enterprise of the future promises something far more dynamic—an environment where businesses are not only more creative, but also more perceptive, autonomous, productive, and conscious. GenAI is driving this transformation – it enables information perception and cognition to allow for decision making, as well as synchronous and asynchronous actions, enhancing efficiency. It’s not just another technological upgrade – it’s a reset button, fundamentally altering how businesses operate and deliver value. From Dreaming to Doing: 3 Key Strategies for Building the Generative Enterprise of the Future Make AI the Backbone of Your Business For AI to deliver transformational outcomes, it must be more than a supplementary tool. It should be deeply integrated into the core of your business, aligning with your values and operational processes. A prime example is the collaboration between Tech Mahindra and a global automotive manufacturer, where advanced safety analytics and omnichannel communication overhauled the recall management system, resulting in several million dollars’ worth of savings in warranty cost and enhanced customer satisfaction through predictive analytics and real-time updates. By aligning AI initiatives with the values that define your business, you can achieve outcomes that go far beyond efficiency gains. Another proven strategy for driving AI adoption across the enterprise is the creation of a Center of Excellence (CoE) that brings together the expertise, resources, and governance necessary to ensure cohesive implementation of AI initiatives. A notable case in point is Tech Mahindra's collaboration with a leading multinational energy company, to improve operational efficiency and foster data-driven decision-making. Together, they established a CoE to implement robotic process automation, process mining, and hyperautomation. This initiative has delivered operational savings of over several million dollars, with more than 240 bots now in production, automating tasks across departments such as finance, supply chain management, HR, and customer care. A CoE, built in partnership with a technology services provider, can be the catalyst for real, impactful AI implementation across the organization. Revolutionize Human-Machine Interaction Gone are the days of rigid workflows. In the generative enterprise, static systems are replaced by dynamic agentic solutions—intuitive interfaces that can adapt, learn, and respond to user intent in real time. A prime example of this transformation can be seen with a global network solutions provider that integrated intelligent agents into its proprietary dashboard tool. This new interface, functioning as a conversational, problem-solving assistant, dramatically improved the efficiency and accuracy of network operations. Tech Mahindra played a pivotal role in this evolution, helping the provider revolutionize its network management system. The introduction of agentic workflows not only delivered significant time savings through automation but also substantially boosted productivity and decision-making accuracy. Powered by GenAI, these intelligent systems are poised to reshape industries by fundamentally changing how we interact with technology. Adaptive, intuitive interfaces are game-changers for productivity, user experience, and operational effectiveness illustrating the profound impact of AI on modern enterprises. Reimagine Global Supply Chains with AI-enabled Solutions In recent years, geopolitical instability and economic disruptions have exposed the fragility of global supply chains. A major issue facing global supply chains is their overreliance on the Asia-Pacific region. For example, 70% of commercial shipbuilding occurs in this region, and Taiwan produces 92% of the world’s most advanced chips. This overreliance has become unsustainable, pushing companies to rethink their global sourcing strategies. With GenAI, businesses can not only address these vulnerabilities, but also build more resilient and adaptable supply chain ecosystems. GenAI is helping businesses change their approach to supply chain management by enabling smart factories that can optimize operations and respond to disruptions in real time. For example, predictive analytics in smart factories can reduce lead times, lower costs, and enhance operational agility. Similarly, AI-powered supply chains can suggest alternative suppliers, adjust logistics, and forecast potential disruptions before they happen. To successfully adopt AI with speed and purpose, enterprises must focus on three key areas: With AI advancing at an unprecedented pace, it’s easy to get trapped in an endless cycle of theoretical models. But if you continue dreaming about the technology’s potential, you will be left behind, while the doers - enterprises that have already embedded GenAI into their DNA - reap the rewards by delivering real, measurable value. The generative future will belong to those who act now. It's time to stop watching the revolution from the sidelines and start leading it. 1.Duncan, D. C. (2024, July 11).

Automation has thus been a cornerstone of technological advancement for many years, streamlining processes and increasing efficiency. The advent of Generative AI (GenAI) represents a significant leap forward, empowering machines to execute pre-programmed tasks and create novel content, further enhancing automation capabilities. However, this is just the beginning. The emergence of Agentic AI promises to redefine automation, unlocking even greater potential for improvements in user experience, cost reduction, and overall productivity across diverse industries, including IT development and service desk operations. A significant challenge in AI-based automation is the often-necessary human-in-the-loop design for complex processes. While AI can generate recommendations and content and even execute actions, human intervention remains crucial for review, refinement, and feedback. This human dependency can significantly limit  cycle times and hinder productivity gains, especially in processes involving multiple handoffs and requiring diverse skill sets. The need for cost reduction and improved user experience highlights the demand for more autonomous systems. Agentic AI systems, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are designed to plan and take actions to achieve goals iteratively. They can perform complex tasks requiring human-like understanding, reasoning, and decision-making. Agentic AI agents possess defined personas, assigned roles, access to tools, and the knowledge to utilize them effectively—much like humans. Unlike traditional AI, which follows predefined instructions, Agentic AI can interact with its environment, collaborate with other AI agents, adapt to new situations, and make autonomous decisions. Imagine a team of individuals with specialized skills working together towards a common goal; that's the power of Agentic AI. This leads to significant improvements in productivity and efficiency. In IT development and support, AI agents can function as developers, reviewing and refactoring code, creating test cases, and performing testing—use cases supported by existing solutions. Similarly, AI agents can augment service desk operations, handling initial interactions, triaging, assigning, and tracking tickets, monitoring SLAs, summarizing incidents, and generating RCA reports. This offers significant potential for cost reduction in IT development and service desk operations. Beyond IT, Agentic AI has broad applications across various domains, including banking (invoice processing, account receivables), insurance (risk assessment, policy issuance, claims processing), healthcare, retail, and logistics. Major technology providers are rapidly integrating Agentic AI into their offerings. Microsoft (with AI Agents working alongside Copilot), Google (through its Vertex AI Agent builder), and Amazon (with Bedrock) are leading this charge. Platforms such as ServiceNow (with its AI Agents), SAP (incorporating AI Agents into its solutions), and Salesforce (with Agentforce) are also actively incorporating these capabilities. This widespread adoption underscores the growing importance of Agentic AI in improving user experience and driving automation across various sectors. Well, not quite. All the checks and balances required for AI based solutions are applicable to Agentic AI systems as well. Agentic AI systems rely on LLM’s, which can hallucinate and are prone to adversarial attack.  Inter-dependent nature of Agentic AI systems can lead to faster, and at times deliberate propagation of failures in the automation chain, resulting in un-intended or harmful outcomes.   Agentic AI systems need ethical and legal safeguards to be built-in, such as ability to monitor, audit, explain, control and when required, shutdown autonomous operations.  As with the emergence and adoption of any new and disruptive technology, governance frameworks are evolving to ensure Agentic AI systems work as intended and have relevant guardrails in place to ensure ethical, legal compliance and mitigate associated risks. We're witnessing a significant shift in customer priorities, with AI, GenAI, and automation increasingly central to RFPs. For the past year, numerous RFPs have explicitly prioritized using automation and GenAI to enhance user experience and drastically minimize human intervention. This reflects a broader trend; clients are actively seeking solutions leveraging AI and GenAI to achieve core business objectives or address the inevitable need to upgrade legacy IT systems. This focus on productivity and cost reduction through advanced automation will only intensify. At a minimum, familiarity with the basic concepts of Agentic AI is crucial for identifying opportunities to integrate these capabilities into deals. Depending on your area of expertise, a deeper understanding of Agentic AI within specific ecosystems—such as hyperscalers (Microsoft, Google, AWS), ITSM/ITOM/workflow platforms (ServiceNow), and CRM/ERP solutions (Salesforce, SAP)—will prove invaluable. This knowledge allows for more objective discussions with Service Line experts, moving beyond generic AI/automation/GenAI statements to articulate specific interventions and measurable outcomes. This approach will result in a more cohesive, compelling, and forward-thinking overall proposition, enhancing both productivity and cost reduction for clients.

LTIMindtree,Rasa and Generative AI: The Two-Pronged Approach to Building Chatbots   | LTIMindtree Blog,"First Name * Last Name * Email Address * Contact Number Your Company's Name * Country * —Please choose an option—United StatesUnited KingdomCanadaFranceGermanySouth AfricaDenmarkSwedenNorwayAustraliaJapanIndiaCosta RicaUnited Arab EmiratesNetherlandsBelgiumAbu DhabiAustriaSaudi ArabiaSingaporeFinlandIrelandSpainPolandPhilippinesQatarMexicoChinaKuwaitOther Your Industry * Banking & Financial ServicesInsuranceRetail & Consumer Packaged GoodsManufacturingEnergyUtilitiesHi-TechCommunications, Media & EntertainmentTravel, Transport & HospitalityHealthLife SciencesOthers Services/Technologies interested in * CloudConsultingDataCustomer SuccessCyber SecurityData and InsightsDigital EngineeringDisruptive SaaSEnterprise ApplicationsPlatform OperationsRPATesting Referred by Search EngineSales PersonTrade Show / ConferencesReferred by PeerReferred by Industry AnalystCorporate ConnectOthers Referred Name Let us know how we can help you today I agree to receive marketing communication from LTIMindtree By submitting my details I agree to LTIMindtree using my personal data as per the LTIMindtree privacy policy By: Ricketa Baptista, Software Engineer, Automation CoE, LTIMindtree Delve into the mechanics of building chatbots using the two conversational AI technologies, Rasa and Generative AI, understand how they leverage human conversations, and explore their differences to uncover which technology aligns best with your needs. In the ever-evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI) landscape, the quest to create more human-like interactions and generate original content has been a driving force in the creation of conversational AI. Today, we’ll explore two remarkable aspects of conversational AI: Rasa, a rule-based butler, and generative AI or Gen AI, a creative, free-spirited artist. Let’s embark on the journey to understand these two technologies and how they have dynamically changed chatbot usage. Picture this: a world where your chatbot comprehends natural language and takes meaningful actions based on that understanding. Rasa can do this for you, and it’s transforming the landscape of conversational AI, helping developers create chatbots that don’t just decode words but understand the nuances of human language. Let’s explore the critical components of Rasa: Rasa NLU: Decoding Natural Language Rasa Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is the language processing powerhouse that takes user inputs, understands the intent, and extracts entities. For instance, if a user says, “Remind me to buy groceries tomorrow,” Rasa NLU recognizes the intent (“set a reminder”) and extracts the entity (“buy groceries”), laying the foundation for the bot’s subsequent actions. Rasa Core: Bringing Conversations to Life Rasa Core takes the conversation to the next level by managing the dialog flow and deciding when and how to respond based on the user’s input and the bot’s capabilities. This means your chatbot can engage in dynamic, context-aware conversations.[i] Fig 1. Example of a Rasa framework Let’s break down the framework in Fig 1. User input: “What’s the weather like tomorrow?” Intent Recognition (Rasa NLU): User’s intent: “weather_query” Entity Extraction (Rasa NLU): Extracts entities – Date: “tomorrow” Entities convey vital user information for the chatbot to understand. Dialogue Management (Rasa Core): The user is seeking weather information; Rasa Core confirms intent, checks context, and may seek location and date confirmation if needed. Bot: “Where are you based?” Action: “weather_api_call ” or “location_question” The bot can then respond with: “The weather in Mumbai tomorrow is expected to be sunny with a high of 35°C.” Now that we have explored the realm of Rasa let’s investigate our next conversational AI topic, which has been buzzing in the industry since the release of ChatGPT in Nov 2022, Gen AI. Generative AI is a field within AI that helps create diverse and original content. Functioning like a supercharged artist, it swiftly produces text, images, sounds, animations, codes, and more, exhibiting remarkable capabilities. The captivating aspect lies in its ability to generate content that feels original and humane, sparking curiosity for the limitless possibilities of AI. Example: DALL-E and the art of image generation OpenAI’s DALL-E, a powerhouse of generative AI models, can generate images from textual descriptions. You throw in a prompt like “sunset at mount fuji with Sakura trees around,” and —DALL-E conjures up a visual representation. Fig 2. Image generated using Dall-E Unraveling the mechanism: How does generative AI work? Fig 3. Gen AI workflow Generative AI models are versatile learners. During their training, they handle a wide range of techniques, including unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. This adaptability allows them to dive into vast amounts of unlabeled data, laying the groundwork for what we call foundation models. They generate human-like content using neural networks, whether text, images, or more, by predicting and completing sequences based on learned associations and producing coherent and contextual outputs.[ii] Example: GPT-3 as a foundation model Consider OpenAI’s GPT-3, a prime example of a foundation model that can comprehend, generate, and even translate text across various languages. While talking about conversational AI, both are powerful tools for natural language processing (NLP), they come with distinct strengths and weaknesses, and choosing between them is a matter of use case and specific requirements. Let’s investigate Rasa and Generative AI, comparing their key features and applications. Rasa takes a dual approach to intent and entity recognition, offering developers the best of both worlds by integrating predefined rules and machine learning models. in the world of Conversational AI is its unparalleled control over conversation flows. Tailor-made for applications requiring specific dialog paths, Rasa enables developers to customize dialog flows, interpret user intents, and manage context effectively. Example: Personalized customer support Rasa evolves through data-driven training. Over time, the Natural Language Processing (NLP) models can be continuously updated and retrained, refining their performance and adapting to changing user behaviors. Flexibility is at the core of Rasa, especially when customizing NLP models. Developers can fine-tune models to align with the specific use cases and domains, ensuring that the conversational AI is finely tuned to user expectations.[iii] Example: Creating personalized chatbot for a restaurant that responds to questions related to menu, ordering process, discount coupons, etc. While Rasa demands proficiency in Python development and NLP, it rewards developers with unparalleled flexibility. The learning curve might be steeper, but the ability to customize conversational AI to unique requirements makes it a preferred choice for those seeking a tailor-made solution. Generative AI impact can be felt with models like GPT-3, which focuses on crafting human-like text based on input prompts. These models, having undergone extensive training on vast amounts of text data, gain the ability to generate innovative responses. Example: Prompting GPT-3 Generative AI simplifies generating natural language responses within conversational contexts. Its applications extend beyond mere text generation, finding a home in chatbots, content creation, and more. In contrast to Rasa, generative AI models cannot enforce specific dialog flows. The generated responses are based on training data patterns and the input, introducing an element of unpredictability. While it’s possible to fine-tune certain aspects of generative AI models, they may not match Rasa’s level of customization. Crafting specific conversational flows and behaviors might have limitations, requiring a delicate balance between customization and model constraints.[iv] Generative AI models offer relative ease of use, requiring minimal setup compared to developing a custom conversational AI solution with Rasa. The simplicity extends to accessibility through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), making them readily available for integration into various applications. We have uncovered the distinct characteristics that set Rasa’s rule-based precision apart from Generative AI’s impact on chatbots. In this blog, I’ve tried to navigate the landscape of conversational AI, providing a comprehensive understanding of both technologies and their differences. Whether you opt for Rasa’s precision or Gen AI’s creative nature, the choice is yours and should be based on the requirements. As technology progresses, anticipate the emergence of hybrid solutions, blending the best of both worlds for nuanced AI-driven interactions.

LTIMindtree,How to Accelerate the Adoption of a Transparent and Adaptable AI?,"First Name * Last Name * Email Address * Contact Number Your Company's Name * Country * —Please choose an option—United StatesUnited KingdomCanadaFranceGermanySouth AfricaDenmarkSwedenNorwayAustraliaJapanIndiaCosta RicaUnited Arab EmiratesNetherlandsBelgiumAbu DhabiAustriaSaudi ArabiaSingaporeFinlandIrelandSpainPolandPhilippinesQatarMexicoChinaKuwaitOther Your Industry * Banking & Financial ServicesInsuranceRetail & Consumer Packaged GoodsManufacturingEnergyUtilitiesHi-TechCommunications, Media & EntertainmentTravel, Transport & HospitalityHealthLife SciencesOthers Services/Technologies interested in * CloudConsultingDataCustomer SuccessCyber SecurityData and InsightsDigital EngineeringDisruptive SaaSEnterprise ApplicationsPlatform OperationsRPATesting Referred by Search EngineSales PersonTrade Show / ConferencesReferred by PeerReferred by Industry AnalystCorporate ConnectOthers Referred Name Let us know how we can help you today I agree to receive marketing communication from LTIMindtree By submitting my details I agree to LTIMindtree using my personal data as per the LTIMindtree privacy policy By: Rakesh Suresh, Associate Principal – Collective Success, LTIMindtree Introduction ChatGPT is an unprecedented gamechanger, especially in terms of breaking product lifecycle records and landing in the trough of disillusionment before we could realize its full potential. On the other hand, enterprises of all sizes are investing time and energy to quickly develop and release their own Large Language Models (LLMs). A recent  Gartner poll found that 45% of 2,500 executives have increased investment in AI due to ChatGPT, with 70% of executives exploring Gen AI in their organizations, and 19% in pilot or production mode. According to Bloomberg, the global Gen AI market is projected to reach a staggering USD 1.3 trillion by 2032, which highlights its immense capability and potential. Fig: Expected GenAI revenue A recent McKinsey report mentions that nearly 75% of the value generated by Gen AI use cases predominantly lie in four key areas: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D. Fig: Transformation enabled by Gen AI But, we should be aware of the fact that Stanford Center for AI Safety has recently concluded in their white paper that most of the developers are not even aware of the characteristics of the AI. Additionally, there are three major challenges with these models: Though there is no panacea to mitigate these challenges immediately, our entire ecosystem comprising of research institutions, private entities, governments are collaborating to find innovative solutions that address the above-mentioned complex challenges efficiently and effectively. One such radical improvement that has caught the attention of experts in recent times is Constitutional AI. This cutting-edge technology proposed by Anthropic in its thesis holds huge potential to revolutionize governance, by using an empirical approach to build safe AI. Constitutional AI (CAI) aims to integrate AI models with constitutional law and governance. At its core, it attempts to augment the decision-making process of models by analyzing huge pile of legal frameworks, historical precedents, and social dynamics to ensure fair and unbiased governance. By leveraging robust Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, CAI can process vast amounts of data, enabling users to make well-informed decisions in real-time. Fig: Anthropic’s CAI approach to training models In the broader sense, CAI refers to the use of AI techniques to supervise and manage the behavior of AI models, including LLMs like GPT-3.5/4. It establishes rules, principles, and ethical guidelines and sets constraints on the outputs generated by AI models to ensure they align with societal values, prevent harmful biases, and maintain ethical standards. Thus, it aims to govern AI models to uphold human rights, privacy, and fairness. Anthropic, an organization that focuses on AI governance, has developed Controlled AI systems using the elements of CAI. OpenAI is also developing AI-powered tools to support legal research and assist policymakers. These systems provide a way to interact with AI models in a safer and more controlled manner, emphasizing responsible and ethical AI use. These Generative AI models cater to distinct aspects of governance like impact analysis, decision augmentation, facilitation, promote transparency, and safeguard constitutional values etc. Amazon Web Services (AWS) While specific CAI initiatives were not widely highlighted, AWS has shown interest in R&D related to rule-based AI systems and explainable AI to enhance transparency. However, AWS offers services like Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Polly, and Amazon Lex that can be customized to align with specific user-defined guidelines for the models. The Amazon Titan FMs are also built to detect and remove harmful content in the data and reject inappropriate content in the user input. They also filter the model’s outputs containing inappropriate content such as hate speech, profanity, and violence. Recently, Amazon has decided to invest billions of dollars in Anthropic to train and deploy future foundation models on AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips, taking advantage of AWS’s high-performance, low-cost machine learning accelerators Microsoft Azure Microsoft has provided guidelines and best practices for responsible AI, which could indirectly contribute to the development of AI models with user-defined rules. Azure offers tools like Azure Machine Learning, Azure’s Cognitive Services suite that bundles services like text analytics and language understanding, which can be customized to adhere to user-defined rules. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is backing up Anthropic with a vision to create safe AI. Besides these, GCP offers services like AutoML like other hyperscalers. All three hyperscale providers are investing a significant amount of time, energy and money in AI research, development, and partnerships to accelerate the ethical aspects of AI, which could contribute to the development of AI systems with user-defined rules. The adoption of CAI by enterprises and businesses is also gaining traction. Organizations are slowly leveraging AI to ensure compliance with laws and regulations thereby enhancing corporate governance and mitigating legal risks. Other potential use cases being contemplated are aiding medical professionals to analyze patients’ medical records, generating responsible responses in customer service or public Q&A/emails/chats, providing superior contact center agent performance, productivity-related search, document editing and content generation, increasing hiring process efficiency by creating job descriptions or analyzing interviews, empowering educational institutions to offer personalized coaching, offering strategic insights to any enterprises to name a few. We at LTIMindtree have enabled many of our customers to embark on this Gen AI-led digital transformation journey. Some of our interesting Gen AI use cases, backed by responsible AI models, include field agent assist, digital twin for industries, earning GPT for investor relations, accelerated code generator, document processing, and content moderation to name a few. Conclusion While AI is becoming an integral part of our daily lives, it is inevitable to have a robust AI governance mechanism. Like the way our constitutions and governance frameworks support, empower and govern us, CAI appears to be a promising governing framework to safeguard us against biased algorithms, revolutionize decision-making processes, enhance transparency, uphold human values, promote equitable, ethical, transparent, and prosperous future in every digital-driven field and industry. CAI promises a world where technology can coexist harmoniously with humanity. And it’s just getting started. Please reach out to us to not only harness the value of Generative AI but also build responsible and safe Generative AI models at scale.

Since then, AI has come a long way and has seen many phases. While earlier AI systems were focused on rule-based reasoning and expert systems, in the second phase (1980–2000), the focus shifted towards data-driven approaches and machine learning. In the third phase (2000–2020), the growth of AI was driven by big data and the cloud, with research expanding to areas like Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Conversational AI. The advent of AI has resulted in the development of niche deep learning models and techniques, along with the emergence of large-scale neural network models. Over the years, developers have built a few models leveraging large-scale neural network types like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). These models, trained on billions of parameters, show better natural language understanding and generation capabilities. The latest iteration of models from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, AWS, and other open-source models from Hugging Face are pushing the boundaries of AI even further. Generative AI refers to a category of machine learning algorithms that generate new data like the original input data. Essentially, these algorithms create something new that mirrors the properties of the given input. These models excel at creating realistic and high-quality data in text, image, audio, or video formats. The key types of Generative AI models include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAE), transformer-based models like the GPT series, and Hugging Face models. The GANs contain two neural networks: the Generator network that generates data and the Discriminator network that distinguishes the generated data from real data. The VAEs use neural networks to encode the data into lower dimensional space and then decode it back, enabling efficient data generation. The transformer models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc., primarily focus on text-based data, using the self-attention mechanism to generate meaningful text using the provided input text data. These text-based models are referred to as Large Language Models (LLMs). These LLMs are typically designed with a large number of parameters and trained on vast amounts of data. For instance, the current generation of the GPT-3 model is built on 570GB of text-based data. It leverages over 175 billion parameters for training the model. These LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks like text generation, summarization, translation, question answering, etc. While the Generative AI foundational models are powerful, organizations require to finetune and manage these models effectively to reap the benefits of these models. The key is to help manage the operational capabilities and infrastructure requirements to help fine-tune the existing foundational models and deploy these refined models. The overall value chain of managing and operationalizing these models comes under Large Language Model Operations (LLMOps). It is a subcategory of ModelOps/MLOps and deals with the LLM’s life cycle management, including fine-tuning, deployment, evaluation, monitoring, and maintenance. The LLMOps landscape includes platforms, frameworks, and support tool chain. Platforms are where you can fine-tune, version, maintain prompts, and deploy the models. These platforms provide the necessary infrastructure and automation support, leveraging frameworks such as LangChain, DUST, etc. This helps AI engineers to build custom LLM-based models and applications quickly. The support tool chain helps to streamline workflows, such as testing prompts (e.g., Promptfoo) and incorporating human feedback. With the rapid advancements in AI, there is a growing need to operationalize LLMs in various applications. Popular open-source AI communities and other well-known organizations are playing a crucial role by contributing to the open-source LLMs like BERT by Google, RoBERTa and LLAMA by Meta AI, GPT by OpenAI Labs, along with a vast transformers library provided by Hugging Face and many more. We can take these open-source, pre-trained LLMs and fine-tune them to align with the specific business requirements. However, operationalizing these LLMs with cross-platform integration can be quite challenging. One such approach could be taking a pre-trained Hugging Face model, fine-tuning, training, and deploying the model on AWS SageMaker. The next step would be inferencing the model with the data stored in the warehousing platforms like Snowflake. Visualizing the data insights can be done using solutions like Streamlit. Let us go through the steps as a part of this approach. Genai snowflake Figure 1 Key Lever for LLMOps on Snowflake Step 1 – Fine-tuning Hugging Face model on SageMaker First, we select an appropriate foundation model for the business need. Hugging Face offers multiple foundation models to choose from. Using SageMaker’s Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers, we can easily run the training and hyperparameter tuning jobs with the pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub. Once the model is finalized, we initialize the SageMaker Hugging Face estimator with the selected model. Here, we also define the number and type of instances needed for model training, the Hugging Face model version, and the hyperparameters required in the tuning job. We also provide the path to the S3 bucket where the training data is stored. We also provide the training script as an entry point, where we define the steps for fine-tuning, load the dataset, and specify our training parameters. Once done, we call the fit method, which initiates the SageMaker training Job. Step 2 – Deploying the fine-tuned model as a SageMaker endpoint The next step is to deploy the fine-tuned model to a SageMaker Endpoint. This SageMaker Endpoint will be used to perform the inference. Here, we will first create a model in SageMaker by pointing to the S3 location where the fine-tuned model artifact is stored. Then we will input the model deployment configurations, such as instance type, instance count, etc. Finally, we will deploy the model to an endpoint for real-time inference. Step 3 – Integrating SageMaker with API Gateway defining the IAM role for Snowflake Once the endpoint is deployed to SageMaker, we set up the API Gateway, which acts as a front door to redirect relevant API requests to the SageMaker Endpoint. Here, we also utilize the capabilities of the AWS Lambda function for handling the requests and responses to and from the SageMaker Endpoint. This Lambda function is also used to perform crucial tasks like Prompt Engineering and format the input data. At this point, we also define the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and policy for allowing the API gateway authorization from our Snowflake account. This acts as a security firewall to safeguard our communication between the AWS API Gateway and Snowflake services. Step 4: Creating an external function in Snowflake External Functions in Snowflake are used to call external APIs, like our API Gateway REST Endpoints, through SQL queries from within Snowflake. To achieve this, we will first create an API integration object in Snowflake to interact with API Gateway. Next, we set up an External Function in Snowflake that calls the API Gateway endpoint. Finally, we use this External Function in our SQL statements to infer our model hosted in SageMaker. The data processing workflows in Snowflake can directly leverage the machine learning capabilities from SageMaker with this setup. This enhances our data visualization and explanations using visualization tools like the Streamlit application. The AI story is becoming important with the rise of LLM as a key pillar for Generative AI. The pivot remains moving towards operationalizing the early-stage proof of concepts (PoC) or minimum lovable products (MLP) into a full-fledged production environment. As the intricacies around the models rise, the emphasis on ensuring the solutions remains the key element for AI-driven growth. LLMOps place a centrifugal force to ensure the operationalization of the LLM use cases at scale. The model, once trained, is well-evaluated and monitored to ensure optimum results for the customers, leveraging the power of Snowflake and AWS SageMaker. Operationalizing LLMOps helps understand LLM behavior and evaluate the critical elements like right-sizing model infrastructure, ensuring optimum model performance, and monitoring. This will help businesses embark on a true digital journey by managing the power of cloud computing with smarter, responsible, and scalable AI insights powered by Generative AI.

It gained widespread recognition with the success of ChatGPT in 2022. AI has always been a strategic asset for IT, but now, generative AI empowers users to leverage it to deliver value quickly. The commercial potential is immense, and many forward-thinking organizations are already experimenting with their generative AI strategy. To capitalize on these opportunities, IT executives are engaging in dialogues around how this technology can transform their business. They aim to seize opportunities and enhance their ability to provide value and gain a competitive advantage. Enterprises have concerns about hallucination (inaccurate or harmful information), data asset mismanagement, and privacy policy issues. They seek robust strategies to address them and achieve faster outcomes. These situations demand some tenets to guide IT executives to craft a persuasive generative AI strategy. Considering all these factors, we have identified three key questions that can shape an enterprise’s generative AI strategy: Since generative AI is so versatile, IT organizations want to leverage the technology for efficiency gains and overcome technical constraints. Before embarking on that journey, they must comprehend the implication of generative AI on the workforce, business models, and data governance policies. They must also understand what kind of innovation will be required to address them. Let’s discuss the implications across the following critical areas and how they can shape your generative AI strategy: Generative AI will redefine the job roles and skill sets of individuals required to synergize with AI. Software engineers can leverage generative low-code platforms to streamline coding workflows, debug, and test but may depend on AI, neglecting the code quality. NYU’s Center for Cybersecurity reports that AI-generated code is often unreliable and insecure, posing a serious security risk as most employees cannot identify code vulnerabilities. Generative AI will advance to review codes and create complex algorithms using prompt engineering and improved recommendation engines. This will disrupt the job roles of software developers and demand new skills and competencies. This technology will enable organizations to use their data assets, workflows, and interfaces in new ways. Enterprises can do this by experimenting with generative AI extensions on their products and value propositions. They will aim to democratize the adoption of generative tools by integrating them with cloud services. New business models, such as inference-as-application Programming Interface (API), End-to-End (E2E) generative services, and vertical-specific generative solutions that embed generative AI as a feature or enhancement, may emerge in the next few years. Generative AI can produce inaccurate or harmful information, known as “hallucination.” This technology can pose serious risks, such as violating intellectual property rights, exposing confidential data, and creating an unintended functionality known as capability overhang. Figure 1: Proactive steps to mitigate genAI implications Organizations should collaborate with third-party providers and experiment with off-the-shelf models before choosing the right implementation approach for their generative AI strategy. This will help them understand the capabilities and limitations of this technology. It will also help to identify the best use cases and scenarios for their business goals. They can also leverage the expertise and experience of third-party providers to develop and deploy generative AI solutions and avoid potential risks and pitfalls. They can also evaluate the performance and accuracy of generative AI models and weigh their benefits and challenges. These evaluations allow them to choose the right implementation approach that aligns with their goals, resources, and constraints. We have identified three significant methods to aid IT leaders choose strategically between fine-tuning off-the-shelf models and developing and training custom models. Figure 2: Gen AI implementation approach Currently, the world relies on pre-trained models capable of performing generic tasks. These models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or domains, such as pattern recognition and sentiment analysis. However, this is not enough for a robust generative AI strategy. These models are still limited by the quality and quantity of training data supplied, availability of computational resources, and expertise to use and maintain them. So, organizations looking to introduce generative models in domain-specific traditional AI applications will need specialized pre-trained models. Considering the complexity of models, lack of data privacy norms, and hallucination-related problems, it will take some time for such models to hit the market. The healthcare industry has already taken the first step in this direction. They are developing specific generative models for specific use cases like drug discovery and molecule engineering. Organizations are stacking prompt engineering on top of pre-trained generic models to develop specialized models. Prompt engineering allows them to leverage the power of pre-trained models without modifying or retraining them from scratch. It also enables them to create more interactive and engaging applications to communicate with users in their natural language. This is just the beginning of the future of gen AI. Once these specialized generative models start to get implemented in traditional AI applications, the newer ecosystem would need to take in a lot of data. This data will be used to generate output straight out of requirements. Implementing organizational data from various domains as connected neural networks will be needed to fulfill the training requirements of such complex generative models. This will create data-centric generative AI, which focuses on improving and enriching training data. One way to achieve data-centric genAI and shape its future is to create an interconnected neural layer between the pre-trained models. The neural layer should connect with the domain-specific application layer. This layer would allow generic pre-trained models to communicate and collaborate with users through prompts and feedback. This layer would also enable self-learning and self-optimization of the AI systems based on their performance and outcomes. The interconnected neural layer would be the new frontier of AI innovation and value creation. It will allow data-centric generative models to become proficient in creating synthetic data and data labeling necessary for creating vanilla-generated or creative applications. This can be achieved without violating the tenets of classical data management, governance, and security. It also allows organizations to harness the diversity and richness of data and knowledge across different domains and disciplines, shaping the future of gen AI. In the long term, organizations should use prompt engineering to enhance existing generative solutions. They must go beyond pre-trained models and explore new ways of creating and using AI. However, generative AI is not the end goal. It is a stepping stone toward what we call emergent AI, which is not predefined or programmed by humans. It is an AI cluster that emerges from the collective intelligence and behavior of multiple generative models, leading to better ambient, adaptive, and predictive intelligence. The future of generative AI is not about pre-trained models alone, as most of the world perceives it. It is about how organizations use them productively, improve them, and create new forms of AI that can emerge from them. While today, it is more about prompt engineering, the way ahead would be data-centric and emergent intelligence.

However, the abilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, are significant as evidenced by the adoption of ChatGPT since in November 2022. ChatGPT is an open-domain LLM-based chatbot that contains around 175 billion parameters. It was trained over an immense text corpus spanning almost the entire internet. As a result, it can generate fluent, grammatically, and syntactically correct text that is consistent with the input prompt. LLM-based chatbots (such as ChatGPT) are a pioneering example of the potential that generative AI offers in customer service automation. While they represent a significant departure from traditional approaches, it is crucial to understand their capabilities, training methodologies, and limitations when compared with human-like conversational capabilities to enhance customer service. The diagram below depicts the capability range of human and chatbot for various tasks and interactions. Figure 1: Complexity of human (conversational) and machine (chatbot) interactions In this blog, we will explore the transformative potential of generative AI-based chatbots (such as ChatGPT) in augmenting customer service operations, focusing on their role as Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration into task-oriented chatbots for the customer support function to provide ‘intelligent’ and ‘human-like’ conversational support to customer inquiries AI chatbots have been experimented with for quite some time now. With the latest technological advancements and the advent of business-specific use cases, AI chatbots have become more sophisticated and are being used by many organizations to automate their business processes and provide a better customer experience. However, there is more to be done than said! Let’s explore chatbots potential in more detail citing ChatGPT as an example. At its core, ChatGPT operates as a Language Model (LM)  within the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP). LMs, which are not a recent invention, lay the groundwork for ChatGPT’s functionality by assigning probabilities to words based on context. Trained on a vast corpus of internet data, ChatGPT analyses input prompts and conversation history to generate contextually relevant responses. While LLM-based chatbots (such as ChatGPT) excel in open-domain conversations, their true potential lies in their integration into task-oriented chatbots. Unlike open-domain chatbots, which engage broadly across topics, task-oriented chatbots focus on specific use cases, such as booking appointments, handling customer inquiries, order cancellations and returns, etc. By leveraging this generative AI-based capability within task-oriented frameworks, organizations can streamline customer service processes and enhance user experiences. Standalone LLM-based chatbots (such as ChatGPT) offer impressive language generation capabilities, and thereby significant advantages, particularly in open-domain contexts. ChatGPT’s ability to generate fluent, contextually appropriate text across diverse topics makes it a valuable tool for content creation and customer interactions. However, it is essential to recognize its limitations, including the inability to perform actions beyond generating text and the risk of producing inaccurate responses (hallucinations) due to its probabilistic nature. Most standalone LLMs lack the ability to use third-party tools to produce relevant responses based on the use case. They can only provide answers generated by using information stored in the model parameters from a time-constrained internet snapshot (e.g. the ChatGPT 3.0 model references data till 2021). As a result, it can only provide answers generated by using information stored in its parameters. To maximize the benefits of LLM-based chatbots (such as ChatGPT) in customer service, organizations must adopt a strategic approach that integrates them effectively into existing workflows. Any organization that has Artificial Intelligence (AI) or its subset generative AI in its customer service enhancement roadmap envisions chatbots that perform more complex tasks than just baseline FAQ informational responses to users’ queries. An FAQ chatbot would have limitations as its output is neither personalized nor can it perform tasks to automate business processes and introduce systemic efficiency. Consider a use case wherein the customer wants to cancel an order. In order that this business process flow is executed from end-to-end by the chatbot, it requires integration with an API (Orders API) with embedded business rules to achieve the desired outcome. Here is a simple description of steps that must executed by the chatbot in a human-like fashion: Figure 2: Complexity of human (conversational) and machine (chatbot) interactions Thus, the idea is to leverage the strengths of a standalone LLM-based chatbot while mitigating its limitations through careful planning and integration strategies. Generative AI-based chatbots (such as ChatGPT) represent a paradigm shift in customer service automation, offering immense potential to streamline processes and enhance user experiences. While such chatbots are not a substitute for human intelligence, their integration into task-oriented chatbot agents can significantly boost productivity and efficiency. When used as standalone systems, LLMs lack the ability to provide maximized returns while implementing solutions in the customer service space. However, when integrated into an ecosystem, LLMs hold the potential to revolutionize customer experiences and solve critical business problems. By harnessing the power of such LLM-based chatbots effectively, organizations can revolutionize their customer service operations and stay ahead in an increasingly competitive landscape.

According to marketresearch.biz, generative AI in the CPG market is projected to grow significantly, reaching USD 5452.4 million by 2032 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.1% from 2024 to 2033. CPG companies can leverage generative AI to improve supply chains, enhance loss prevention, and promote sustainability. Additionally, generative AI will accelerate R&D innovations, helping companies bring products to market faster than their competitors. McKinsey’s research highlights that product managers (PMs) using gen AI can speed up time to market by 5% and enhance productivity by 40%. Traditionally, the CPG industry has relied on after-the-fact measurement studies for precise market understanding, often partnering with third-party syndicated data providers. These partnerships grant CPG companies access to granular, zip code-level data, which can be merged with enterprise data to extract game-changing insights. However, the rapid pace of market change makes it challenging for CPG companies to analyze this data quickly and effectively due to: Figure 1: Challenges of data quality and inconsistencies Figure 2: Challenges of fragmented insights Gen AI-based solutions can utilize a dynamic agent-based model tailored for the CPG industry, involving a sophisticated multi-agent network centered around a central agent. This central agent, powered by a large language model, efficiently captures specific user requirements and breaks them down into smaller tasks assigned to specialized sub-agents. Each sub-agent, also coupled with large language model capabilities, handles different data dimensions. When a query or task is received by the central agent, these sub-agents act on connected data dimensions to create relevant outputs. The output generated by each queried sub-agent are then converged by the central agent to create meaningful insights. Figure 3: Gen AI and LLM-enabled dynamic agent-based model approach By integrating multiple data sources, this approach eliminates data silos and ensures cohesive and comprehensive analysis of market dynamics at a granular level. This allows for the delivery of real-time actionable insights tailored to meet the specific needs of different CPG personas, enhancing decision-making and giving businesses a competitive edge in a rapidly changing market. Data harmonization using agentic workflows Converging insights from different generative AI-powered agentic workflow solutions The central agent accepts user queries or actions through a conversation assistant UI/UX screen and breaks the user prompt into smaller chunks of queries and actions. Sub-agents receive queries or actions from the central agent, process them, and send the output back to the central agent. The central agent converges these outputs to create meaningful insights, which can be presented to the user in various formats such as reports, dashboards, text, voice, etc. The introduction of a multi-agent solution approach brings many benefits to the CPG industry, including: LTIMindtree has worked extensively to create a Gen AI offering that follows the above solution approach to enable CPG organizations to be Gen AI ready and realize its benefits, making them more agile, data and insights driven. At LTIMindtree, we understand the ever-evolving technological needs of CPG businesses.

The digital payment transaction volume is expected to reach USD 36.75 trillion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 15.71% from 2024[i]. However, while digital payments have become simpler for users, the complexity keeps increasing for banks and financial service providers. Financial institutions must proactively detect and manage cyber security threats, operational risks, and regulatory compliance while reducing operational costs to enhance customer experience and improve market share. However, even a single error in the payment system can be costly and lead to financial losses and significant fines. This is where generative AI’s (Gen AI’s) ability to analyze complex data sets in real-time can help the payments domain. In this article, we will explore the effectiveness and capabilities of generative AI in the payments domain. While digital payments offer immense convenience, they are not without significant vulnerabilities. The industry faces frequent incidents of fraud, data breaches, and inefficient transaction processes that impact both consumers and financial institutions. For instance, recent data breaches at major financial services firms exposed millions of customer records, highlighting the urgent need for more robust security measures. Additionally, outdated systems that cannot handle the increasing transaction volume contribute to operational inefficiencies, resulting in slower processing times and customer dissatisfaction. Global losses from payment card fraud are projected to reach USD 400 billion over the next ten years, with authorized push payment fraud alone expected to grow at 11 percent CAGR from 2023 to 2027[ii]. Given the rising volume and complexity of digital transactions, financial institutions must adopt enhanced security and streamlined workflows to protect customers and reduce operational costs. Fraud detection has traditionally relied on rule-based systems that struggle to keep up with evolving threats. Generative AI, however, introduces a dynamic, data-driven approach to fraud prevention by analyzing vast amounts of transaction data in real time. Through pattern recognition, Gen AI can detect unusual behaviors and anomalies that might indicate fraudulent activity. Here are a few ways in which Gen AI can help the industry minimize fraud: Security remains a non-negotiable in the world of digital payments, with institutions constantly seeking advanced methods to protect transaction data. Here are a few ways in which security can be enhanced by generative AI in payments: In addition to security, generative AI significantly improves transaction efficiency by streamlining workflows and reducing manual intervention. Here’s how: Here’s how institutions can leverage Generative AI in the payments industry to enhance compliance efforts: Generative AI is revolutionizing cards and payments by enhancing security, efficiency, and compliance. Its ability to analyze vast data sets in real time, detect fraud, adapt to new threats, and automate manual processes makes it indispensable for financial institutions. With rising fraud risks and record-high AML fines that exceeded USD 6 billion in 2023[vii], adopting AI-driven solutions is no longer optional but essential. Generative AI helps financial organizations to fortify transaction security, streamline operations, and deliver seamless customer experiences. By leveraging this technology, institutions can meet growing demands for secure, efficient payments while building trust and staying competitive in an evolving financial landscape.

While this revolution is reshaping productivity, and creativity, and enabling new business models, ensuring that GenAI remains inclusive and unbiased is a pivotal challenge. To fully harness its power, organizations must prioritize diversity and inclusivity in both the development and application of GenAI. According to a NASSCOM survey, the trend in GenAI in terms of the gender gap becomes even more pronounced with increased years of experience, widening to a 63% difference at the senior management level and a 43% difference at the mid-management level. What’s astonishing is that at junior levels as well, 33% of women are GenAI professionals, highlighting the need for targeted efforts to build a robust pipeline and reduce this disparity. The question remains: How can GenAI be leveraged to not only drive innovation but also foster inclusivity, especially for women in tech? As AI systems increasingly influence decision-making, ethical considerations are gaining prominence. There is an increasing emphasis on ethical AI, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, which are central to building trust in AI systems. Creating impartial pathways for women not only drives richer innovation but also builds a stronger GenAI landscape that reflects our diverse society. As organizations drive a GenAI-first agenda, integrating ethical AI practices is essential. GenAI systems must be designed and deployed responsibly to ensure they don’t reinforce existing biases or create new ones. Incorporating ethical training into GenAI strategies is critical for achieving this. Creating impartial pathways for women in specialized roles in ethical AI compliance and audit not only drives richer innovation but also builds a stronger GenAI landscape that reflects our diverse society and builds trusted AI solutions Organizations must establish clear ethical guidelines that outline their commitment to responsible AI development, addressing issues such as bias mitigation, transparency, and accountability. Ensure that any data used for AI solutions are not gender biased for an equitable workforce adoption. At LTIMindtree, we believe GenAI is not only a groundbreaking technology but also a catalyst for inclusivity. While the advancements in GenAI presents unique challenges for women in tech, it also offers immense potential to address systemic barriers and create equitable opportunities. We are committed to leveraging this transformative power to foster a more inclusive environment where women can thrive as innovators and leaders. Our approach ensures that women have the resources, support, and opportunities they need to overcome barriers, stay competitive, and contribute meaningfully to the Generative AI revolution. According to the World Economic Forum, only 22% of AI professionals are women, highlighting a significant gender disparity in the industry. To create a more inclusive GenAI landscape, organizations need a multi-faceted approach that tackles recruitment, retention, leadership development, and workplace culture. Here are several strategies to ensure women are empowered in the GenAI revolution: To ensure progress, sustained diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives are essential. These initiatives should focus on: We firmly believe that GenAI has the potential to create a transformative impact on gender diversity in tech. The findings of NASSCOM study, highlights that overall adoption of GenAI across Indian men and women is higher with 76% male professionals and 80% female professionals. Also 72% of women and 66% of men turn to GenAI tools for efficiency improvement. Interestingly we also see senior tech women exceed their male peers in GenAI adoption by 12% globally. This progress reflects the growing momentum of women leaders paving the way in GenAI innovation. As more women step into this space, GenAI becomes a catalyst for fostering inclusivity, breaking barriers, and amplifying diverse voices. By actively prioritizing inclusivity through targeted initiatives, organizations can ensure that GenAI not only drives technological innovation but also shapes a more equitable industry. At LTIMindtree, we remain committed to leveraging GenAI as a force to inspire, empower, and create a balanced and just future for all.

Banks and financial institutions were forced to reassess their operations, governance and controls, risk management policies, and data and systems infrastructure, increasing their compliance burden. According to a KPMG survey[ii], 87% of banking executives believe that addressing the cost of risk and compliance is most important for unlocking new value optimization opportunities. In fact, well-managed risk can help banks not only improve stability, integrity, competitiveness, and customer trust but also reduce operational costs by up to 25%[iii]. Many banks are turning to generative AI to unlock this value. Already used to drive productivity and sustainability, Gen AI can also automate risk assessments and continuously monitor compliance, ensuring that risk management practices are up-to-date and effective. This article will discuss how financial institutions can use Gen AI to manage risk and compliance effectively and identify a few use cases that can help leaders drive value. Global financial institutions face many challenges in managing risk and staying compliant with ever-changing regulations. Many banks still use old-fashioned, manual processes to check transactions, monitor compliance, and spot risks. This reliance on manual work causes inefficiencies and delays in decision-making and often leads to mistakes like false positives. These issues not only drive up costs but also slow down how quickly banks can react to potential risks. Another problem is that banks have a lot of data scattered across different departments and locations, which we call data silos. This makes it hard to get a complete picture of risks, leading to incomplete insights and potential blind spots. Bringing all this data together is tough and expensive but necessary for accurate risk assessment. Moreover, banks operating globally must deal with complex and varied regulations that change frequently to tackle new types of financial crimes and threats. Keeping up with these rules demands dedicated teams and advanced tools, straining budgets and resources. Given these challenges, banks urgently need better risk management solutions. Generative AI is changing how global banks manage risk by providing real-time insights and advanced data analysis. Using techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AI creates synthetic transactions that enhance data sets, improving predictive analytics for risk management. This is vital for tasks like Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks, and monitoring transactions. Gen AI tools help streamline KYC processes and uncover hidden data connections. In regulatory compliance, Gen AI can help banks spot issues quickly, boost fraud detection, and handle risks related to digital assets. It enhances scenario analysis and prediction, allowing banks to tackle compliance challenges before they arise. For example, in trade surveillance, AI can identify market manipulation by generating alerts and patterns, and in financial risk modeling, it simulates risks across different scenarios, clarifying asset exposures. Generative AI also aids in regulatory reporting by tracking updates, drafting documents, and simplifying compliance tasks. This ensures banks stay aligned with new rules. In Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) management, AI guides sustainability goals and consistent reporting across regions. AI’s fraud detection models, supported by GANs, predict and flag suspicious activities using synthetic data to highlight potential fraud. This comprehensive approach helps banks effectively manage evolving risks. Generative AI can help banks build an Active Risk and Compliance Management (ARCM) 2nd LoD framework tailored to regulatory requirements. By coupling classical AI/ML with GenAI, banks can create a recommendation and hierarchical engine that organizes the Risk and Control Matrix (RCM) based on specific legislations and activities. This setup supports progressive elaboration, allowing new regulations or requirements to be seamlessly integrated. GenAI facilitates the creation of a sophisticated risk taxonomy, complete with controls and monitoring systems aligned with this taxonomy, ensuring all compliance areas are comprehensively addressed. Here is a detailed dive into how Gen AI combined with classical AI can help create an operational risk management control framework: How does LTIMindtree use AI in financial risk management? We have successfully implemented Gen AI to improve risk management and compliance for several financial institutions. Integrating generative AI into risk management and compliance has redefined these critical areas for financial services. 68%[iv] of US executives believe that risk and compliance are the top priority areas for using Gen AI in their companies. As the financial services sector continues to navigate a complex regulatory environment and the challenges of risk management, organizations must adopt Gen AI-powered solutions. By automating labor-intensive processes, delivering predictive insights, and improving accuracy, generative AI is enabling banks to better protect themselves and their customers against financial threats. Financial institutions that embrace AI-driven risk and compliance tools can reduce costs, respond faster to regulatory changes, and create a more resilient and trustworthy financial system. As the industry continues to evolve, adopting generative AI will be key for banks to stay ahead and build a future-ready foundation for risk management and compliance.

The atmosphere murmured with anticipation as over 16,000 industry leaders and innovators gathered in-person to explore the latest advancements in AI capabilities and scalable data engineering. The event centered on demonstrating how these new-edge technologies are transforming industries and driving global progress. The summit emerged as a pivotal event for experts and enthusiasts alike, coming together to delve into the modern advancements that are altering digital landscapes worldwide. From innovative developments in data management to advanced artificial intelligence (AI) applications, Databricks has positioned itself at the forefront of unprecedented innovation. This year, three key themes stood out: Enhancing Databricks UniForm with Tabular Acquisition One of the most exciting announcements at the summit was the enhancement of Databricks UniForm. Imagine seamlessly integrating Delta and Iceberg formats into one cohesive platform. That’s exactly what Databricks has achieved, breaking down data silos and enabling smooth data management across analytics tools and engines. This was no small feat, accomplished through collaboration with the Iceberg team. Have you ever faced the frustration of managing disparate data formats? This integration promises to be a game-changer, offering interoperability across Apache Hudi, Iceberg, and Delta Lake ecosystems. It felt like watching a jigsaw puzzle come together perfectly, each piece fitting seamlessly. Optimizing Data Warehousing with Serverless Architecture Another highlight was the introduction of a serverless architecture for data warehousing. If you’re like me, you have spent countless hours fine-tuning performance manually. Databricks’ AI-driven performance enhancements eliminate this hassle, allowing for automatic cost and performance optimization. And the best part? You can now access GenAI applications via structured query language (SQL), simplifying integration and boosting efficiency. How much time could you save with a fully optimized, serverless data warehouse? This was like moving from manual to automatic–less effort, better results. User-Friendly AI/BI Databricks also rolled out their new AI/business intelligence (BI) tools, designed to provide deep insights and simplify analysis. With AI/BI dashboards and Genie, self-service BI and governance are now within reach for everyone in the organization. These tools enhance data lifecycle management, making it easier to turn raw data into actionable insights. Have you ever wished for a more intuitive way to analyze your data? Databricks AI/BI might be the solution you’ve been looking for. Picture this: a dashboard that not only shows you the numbers but also tells you what they mean in a straightforward way. It’s like having a personal data analyst at your fingertips. Streamlined Data Pipeline Management with LakeFlow LakeFlow was another standout feature at the summit. This tool allows you to ingest data from various sources and transform it in both batch and real-time using SQL and Python. Its user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) makes pipeline creation a breeze, accelerating development and deployment. And with full observability, you can monitor your pipelines with confidence. Imagine the efficiency boost for your data pipeline management with a tool like LakeFlow. It ensures you can observe your pipelines, thereby guiding data smoothly from source to destination. Advancing Data and AI Governance and Collaboration Governance was a hot topic at the summit, with the introduction of Unity Catalog. This open-source platform supports multi-format, multi-engine governance, emphasizing connectivity, unified governance, and accessibility. Databricks is also pushing the envelope with the Delta Sharing protocol, Databricks Marketplace, and Clean Rooms for secure collaboration. These advancements are designed to foster innovation while maintaining robust data governance. Unity Catalog’s open approach is like setting up a fortress around your data, ensuring it’s well-protected yet easily accessible for those who need it. Delta 4.0 Delta 4.0 was another major announcement, offering enhanced storage and processing capabilities for modern data formats like extensible markup language (XML) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). With improved performance, faster read and write operations, and features like identity columns and type widening, Delta 4.0 is set to redefine data management. Have you struggled with latency issues or complex schema management? Delta 4.0 addresses these challenges head-on. The enhancements in Delta 4.0 make data handling not just better, but significantly more efficient and user-friendly. Unified AI and ML Solution Lifecycle Management Mosaic AI tools were a big focus as well, covering model development, deployment, and monitoring. These advanced AI techniques enhance model sophistication and performance, seamlessly integrating with enterprise data sources on the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform. If you’ve been looking for a comprehensive solution for AI and machine learning (ML) lifecycle management, Mosaic AI might just be the answer. With these tools, managing the AI and ML lifecycle becomes less of a challenge and more of an integrated part of your data strategy. The Databricks Summit 2024 was a testament to the relentless drive for innovation in data and AI. By addressing key themes such as Gen AI deployment, security, and unified data management, Databricks pushed the boundaries of what was possible. The enhancements to Databricks UniForm, the introduction of serverless architecture for data warehousing, and user-friendly AI/BI tools signified a future where data management is seamless and intuitive. Tools like LakeFlow streamlined pipeline management, while advancements in governance through Unity Catalog and Delta Sharing ensured robust data protection and collaboration. These developments not only streamlined operations but also democratized AI, making sophisticated tools accessible to businesses of all sizes. LTIMindtree’s role in showcasing industry-specific applications highlighted our commitment to leveraging these advancements for transformative outcomes. As Databricks continues to lead the charge, the possibilities for innovation and growth in the data and AI landscape appeares boundless.
