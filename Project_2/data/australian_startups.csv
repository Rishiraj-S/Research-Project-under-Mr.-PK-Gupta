Problem Solving Reasoning abilities that enable GEAR to understand and solve problems Systems Management The ability to understand how an environment or system comes together Dynamic modelâ¨Building Building models of the world that enable highly soph -isticated scenario analysis Social Connection The ability to understand peopleâs emotions and adapt responses How it works 01 Collect data GEAR collects data on you and your world GEAR breaks down its understanding of the world into three data points - time, location and a third special variable called âsemanticsâ. These are captured through a number of different sensors - we call these embodiments. 02 Map your world GEAR then maps your world This box represents your world. This point represents GEARâs best understanding of you at that point in time - the time, your location and everything else captured by the sensors. Multiply this by millions of other moments in your life and youâll get a box that more closely represents this. 03 Understand goals How GEAR works with this data GEAR also takes note of your needs or goals that youâve expressed. It could be something as simple as âI want to live a healthier lifeâ. GEAR takes all these goals and maps out what your life would look like with these goals achieved. 04 Chart course And helps chart a course to a more actualised life Finally, with GEAR having a clear understanding of where you are presently and what your goals are, it can help chart a course to those goals.

Yes, GEAR is a form of Artificial General Intelligence with emergent capabilities. We take this responsibility seriously, which is why we incorporated as a public benefit company. How is this different to generative AI? GEAR is a form of generative AI in that it can generate an output. GEAR has unique capabilities in that it also generates a dynamic model of the world, and simulates approaches to solve a given problem or reach a goal state. This means it has potential to deal with many tasks that challenge classic GenAI today. Can GEAR generate text, images and audio? Yes. However GEARâs main focus is on generating human communication (text, audio, reports). â GEAR also creates dynamic maps of event trajectories to augment human life, and reports on human wellbeing and goal optimization. Can I use GEAR today? Today GEAR is only available to health insurance and clinical trial partners, people with Government support packages, and for special projects (eg advanced robotics deployments). When will GEAR be available? In the next phase, 2024, we will make GEAR more broadly available to a wider range of partners. Broader public deployment will come after that. Do you use ChatGPT or other foundation models? Akin is a frontier AI developer. We have a proprietary frontier model and are not dependent on other systems.

Our Ethos Our Technology Solutions Health Frontier AI Government Personal AI Space Our Company About Akin News Our Research Industry Frontier Model AI Industry Perspective DARPA, a US government agency at the forefront of emerging technologies describes the development of AI in three waves. Wave 1 of AI saw the design and building of AI that could reason, but not learn. These were early systems designed to use symbolic thinking to solve problems. They require a lot of training, are brittle outside of their domain of knowledge, but are still in mainstream use today as expert systems or traffic managers over statistical learning AI. We then moved to Wave 2 of AI, where we saw the design of AI that could learn, but not reason. This is where we are today with the proliferation of large language models, and other forms of statistical learning. These systems require large amounts of compute and data for âbrute force learningâ and lack true comprehension or adaptive reasoning. AI has not had a significant paradigm shift since moving to Wave 2 in the 1980âs. AI is in need of a new approach to evolve into Wave 3 - computers that can both reason and learn. Adaptive reasoning AI should be able to build models on the fly, explain real-world phenomena, adapt dynamically and solve problems. How Akin Can Help Akin has developed a novel approach to AI moving closer to this third wave of evolution. At its core, Akin has developed an AI based on the notion of symbiosis - an AI system that can adapt dynamically to whomever is using the technology and the environment around them. Akinâs AI is able to work in complex systems with multiple feedback loops, solve complex problems, and have greater empathy and awareness of the goals of its user.

Our Ethos Our Technology Solutions Health Frontier AI Government Personal AI Space Our Company About Akin News Our Research Industry Space, Ecosystem Modeling Industry Perspective Space is set to grow from a 350 Billion dollar industry to an over 1 trillion dollar industry in the coming decades [1]. The drivers for this are: The rise of a new technology race and tension between large geo-political powers, The rapid increase in AI and supporting technologies, and the privatization of the space industry, A new shared vision for humanity â an increased sense that humanity is exceeding the capacity of our planet, and our species needs to evolve. True AI intelligence emerging in parallel with space exploration and colonisation presents a historically unprecedented opportunity. We have the opportunity to create a new form of AI-human collaboration and steward the responsible co-evolution between AI and humanity. This same deep science can then be applied to the lives of over seven billion humans on our planet. Personal AI can be used to help run every home, and to optimize for individual and collective wellbeing. [1] The Space Economy: An Industry Takes Off, U.S. Chamber of Commerce â How Akin Can Help Akin has developed advanced AI and robotics for the space industry, to act as long-duration assistants and companions. Our AI software fills the roles of: Helper AI: performing complex tasks, Companion AI: acting as a member of a social group, Ambient AI: running a habitat and optimizing for wellbeing (decision core). The constraints of space compel significant innovation. In space, compute power is scarce, and data has to be moved around in slow and costly packets. AI developed for the space sector has to be highly compliant, able to reason through things with minimal human support, all while functioning in low-compute, low-data environments.

Our Ethos Our Technology Solutions Health Frontier AI Government Personal AI Space Our Company About Akin News Our Research September 1, 2023 aKin launches Limbic Scaffolding for advanced generative AI + multiple embodiments aKin has successfully completed a Federal - Funded project called Limbic Scaffolding - a platform to more rapidly assemble âbrain and bodyâ combinations for advanced generative AI with emotional awareness, for robotic systems and ambient AI. Limbic scaffolding for advanced support cobots View Source Project description and overview: Industrial robots have become a common feature in modern production-line processes, but are limited to simple, repetitive tasks. Interactive cobots are more advanced and capable of customised tasks, working alongside humans, accepting feedback, problem-solving together, and reporting on progress. Industrial and commercial cobots/robots suffer from the lack of a common interface that can link sensory input to analytical and interactive capabilities. A âscaffoldingâ layer is needed to couple deep intelligence, software controllers and robotic hardware such as actuators and sensors. The brain, controller, and embodiment components are typically built as separate silos, which causes the following problems: Added expense and slow prototyping Reduced efficacy and usefulness Limited use cases Making cobots/robots less human-like aKinâs solution brings together brains and bodies via a limbic scaffolding for advanced support cobots. A-kin wants to build intelligent robotic assistants to enable advanced manufacturing via complex production tasks, while interacting with humans and performing real-time analytics. They will be able to take unique instructions from people to complete tasks and analyse task performance. A-kin will develop a limbic scaffolding layer that will make it easier to couple a brain, controller, and hardware embodiment together. The purpose of this scaffolding will be to enable faster development and greater component interoperability for custom cobots/robot prototypes that need to be integrated with an AI core. The value proposition of the proposed platform will be in abstracting away differences in hardware, making it possible to create more generic cobots/robots which can be quickly repurposed for a different task, or to create multiple variants of the same cobot/robot for the same task, and pick the best one. The A-kin platform will streamline this process and allow developers to focus on the high-value activities of the prototype development rather than the rudimentary integration details. aKin calls this platform the âlimbic scaffoldingâ as an analogy to the equivalent part of the human brain, which is responsible for integrating sensory, cognitive and effector functions. Therefore âlimbic scaffoldingâ represents its role in bringing together sensory awareness, cognitive function, and actions. In addition to building the limbic scaffolding platform, A-kin will test this across two embodiments and two use cases, which will demonstrate the capabilities of the platform. This project will allow A-kin to validate custom robot prototypes and showcase how the limbic scaffolding platform can be used for faster development of cobots across multiple sectors. This project provides an opportunity for Australia to develop custom high-end intelligent cobots/robots, which can be deployed in multiple industry settings to undertake complex tasks. The project will fuel the potential to export not only customised intelligent cobots/robots, but also bundled components, including hardware add-ons with software embedded. EXPECTED IMPACT Increased spending on R&D Larger patent portfolio Increased collaboration with other manufacturers Increased number of staff with science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) skills Increased levels of automation and digitalisation Higher marketing expenditure Larger geographical reach EXPECTED GROWTH A-kin estimated revenue: 2022 $300,000 2023 $800,000 2024 $1.2 million 2025 $4 million EXPECTED JOBS A-kin anticipates this project will employ an additional 2 software engineers Contributions: Government Funds: $200,000 | Industry: $200,000 | In-Kind: $75,000 Project Collaborators Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â  Â Â  Â â â All blog posts September 19, 2023 TEDx Sydney 2023 - Liesl Yearsley Liesl Yearsley has been developing AI for 20 years.

Castlepoint helps you prepare for a GenAI rollout by protecting sensitive content, monitoring AI usage, and ensuring the quality and security of all content ingested and produced. Control the Narrative: Secure and Effective Generative AI Use Many organisations struggle to manage the governance implications of GenAI and fail to fully realise its potential benefits. With Castlepoint, you can confidently control what data GenAI systems access and ensure that outputs are based on accurate, relevant, and safe data. We review and assign legal retention periods to legacy content, allowing you to dispose of outdated information or exclude it from GenAIâs scope, reducing the risk of generating inaccurate or harmful results. Castlepoint also flags risky or controversial data before and during GenAI use, so you can clean up sensitive information before it becomes part of a search result. â Key capabilities Preparation Audit your data estate and clean up sensitive and obsolete data before rolling out GenAI, ensuring only relevant content is accessed. GenAI Hygiene Maintain clean data inputs over time, ensuring high-quality results from your Generative AI systems. Monitoring Oversee GenAI usage, tracking who is using the system and where the results are coming from, for complete oversight. Benefits Data Integrity and Control : The quality of your GenAI outputs is determined Â by the quality of the inputs. Castlepoint ensures that only valid and Â reusable content is available to GenAI by reading and classifying all legacy Â content, allowing you to dispose of irrelevant data. Â  Â Reduced Risk: Castlepoint mitigates the risk of bias, errors, and Â unintended harm by preventing outdated or sensitive data from being surfaced Â in AI-generated content. Clean, accurate data leads to better outcomes. Controls Privacy, Safety, and Security: GenAI brings significant privacy and Â security risks due to the amount of data it accesses. Castlepoint identifies Â and flags PII, classified data, trade secrets, and other sensitive content, Â ensuring it isnât exposed by GenAI. Â  Â AI Usage Monitoring: Gain full visibility into who is using GenAI, what Â data they are accessing, and whether the content is appropriate for AI-driven Â decisions. Castlepoint alerts you to potential misuse, ensuring compliance Â and data integrity throughout your network. Savings Reduce Costs and Time: Preparing for a GenAI deployment is often costly and Â time-consuming, requiring extensive searches across repositories. Castlepoint Â automates this process by registering, indexing, and classifying all your Â content, providing decision support without the overheads. Â  Â Post-Deployment Support: Castlepoint continues to work for you even after Â GenAI deployment, continuously reading, classifying, and reporting on Â obsolete or risky data, keeping your content secure and compliant at all Â times. Â  Â Boost Productivity: Better inputs equal better outputs, increasing Â productivity and maximising the value of your Generative AI system. Control your risk, command your data.

About Us î  Our Story Our Clients Join the Team Resources î  Case Studies Articles Media Mentions Pricing Solutions î  AI Team Audit Team Cyber Team Legal Team Privacy Team RecordsÂ Team Platform î  Audit and Assurance Cyber Security Discovery Generative AI Privacy Management Records Management Get in touch Contact us Our Story Pioneering Data Governance and Information Security â In 2012, Castlepointâs founders launched a specialist consulting firm, offering expert cyber security, records management, and audit services to Central and Federal Government agencies as well as large regulated industries. â Years of government audits revealed a widespread failure among regulated entities to protect high-risk, high-value information. The Castlepoint founders identified a strong desire for improved data governance, risk management, and compliance within these organisations. However, they were limited by ineffective technology that only exacerbated the issues it aimed to solve, leading to inefficiencies in user experiences, systems, and data management processes. Recognising the need for a new way to manage information, Castlepointâs founders envisioned a solution capable of managing all types of data, across all platforms â both on-premises and in the cloud. The solution had to address the entire data lifecycle holistically, recognising that security, compliance, and data discovery are inherently interdependent. The solution needed to apply comprehensive data rules, including secrecy provisions, information handling, privacy obligations, and records retention policies. It had to be seamless and invisible to users, requiring no changes to existing systems or creating additional management burdens for governance teams. Additionally, it needed to avoid unnecessary data movement or modification. The Data Castle paradigm was created. Designed by leading experts, the system was built to meet over 900 legal and industry-standard requirements. Powered by cutting-edge AI technology, it is scalable, simple, and secure â the first manage-in-place solution with Explainable AI, revolutionising information governance. Launched in 2019, Castlepointâs innovative solution was rapidly adopted by government departments, and remains the preferred choice for organisations seeking to understand and manage their own data, minimise risk, and enhance compliance. Today, Castlepoint operates globally, with offices in Australia and the UK, providing enterprise data governance AI software to regulated industries worldwide. Meet Our CEO: Rachael Greaves Rachael Greaves, Castlepointâs CEO, is a certified auditor, privacy systems engineer, security manager, and records manager. Recognised as Australia's Most Outstanding Woman in IT Security, RegTech Female Entrepreneur of the Year, and listed among the Women in Fintech Powerlist and Top 100 Innovators, Rachael is a true industry leader. âItâs not well understood that information management can be a matter of literally life or death,â she said. âFailure to manage information properly has led to completely preventable catastrophes; not just breaches of information security like Office of Personal Management in the US, which has undermined national security for two generations, but also lapses in information retention, quality, and access. Poor data protection, preservation, and privacy practices have led to individuals being dispossessed, discriminated against, and deported. It has resulted in preventable deaths and other harms, often to the most vulnerable. And managing data properly is not just about reducing risk: data is our most valuable asset, and we also need to be able to exploit it effectively.â âWe are finally able to catch up with the exponential growth in data and get ahead of it again and doing that can save lives and livelihoods,â she said. âThe traditional models for managing information do not work well anymore. We have an obligation to manage information compliantly and securely, and the commercial and operational benefits of doing so are enormous. Knowing what you have and where, makes you faster, more responsive, and smarter with data. It's simple and fast to put enterprise-wide controls in place using Castlepoint, without any downsides. And not least, it's just the right thing to do. Our values align with your values. We can help you to protect and help others, as well as your own personnel, data, and operations.â Our values Ethics Passionate â we care about other people and their problems. Virtuous â we are on the side of good and we fight against bad actors. Protective â we do everything we can to defend you from bad outcomes. Generous â we are all in this together, and we share what we know for the good of all. Integrity Trustworthy â we always follow the rules and do the right thing. Inclusive â we work well with everyone to get the job done. Straightforward â we always keep it simple, clear, and unclouded. Knowledgeable â we know what we are doing, and we are true experts. Hard work Reliable â we always deliver, and we do what we promise. Collaborative â we work closely with you to optimise the outcomes. Insightful â we are intelligent and worldly because we work to understand things. Professional â we are a sophisticated organisation with great people and processes.

This involves designing and building a tailored AI solution that delivers rapid results and an outstanding return on your investment – all while remaining agile enough to grow and evolve with your future business requirements. Initial Discovery While most businesses understand the need for AI solutions to grow their organisation, many still cannot picture what AI looks like in their business, or what problems it’s going to solve. That’s why we begin with an initial discovery session to help us get to know each other. We take the time to understand your business so we can demonstrate exactly how AI solutions can work to streamline your current workflow and enhance your operations. Consultation Throughout the consultation stage, we work closely with you to understand the problems you’re looking to solve using AI technology (and the ones you didn’t know you could) so we can determine how best to reach the outcomes your business is after. Boasting a team of skilled AI experts covering disciplines including software development, automation, process design and business analysis, we work together to achieve the seamless design, build and implementation of your AI tech solutions. Build & Test This is when we begin to build and test your new Business AI solutions in a way that works for your organisation to help provide you with immediate benefits from the outset. As part of this step, you’ll also get the opportunity to gain valuable experience in working with your AI-powered solutions so you can become comfortable with the technology before we complete the full implementation. Implementation At this stage, we work with your team directly to implement a high-level AI workflow that covers all required data inputs and outputs within your operation. We also conduct a thorough security review throughout the process to ensure your business remains safe and protected online before we finish with the final stages of implementation. Following the completion of your implementation, we conduct ongoing reviews and monitor your AI technology solutions to efficiently identify areas for refinement or improvement over time. Management & Support Once your AI tech solution has been successfully integrated into your business operations, we offer valuable resources to assist you and your team with functional training so you can operate your new AI-powered systems and processes. We also provide on-the-job and role-specific training if required, building upon what we offer within our initial training resources, to help your team become more comfortable with your new AI solutions. Additionally, our team can continue to take care of your AI technology needs on an ongoing basis through our AI Managed Services, ensuring your business is always operating at maximum efficiency and effectiveness.

At the same time, customers now have the choice of more providers than ever before, and the vertically integrated entities that once dominated the industry have been broken up and are now operating as independent businesses. What’s more, the processes that underpin the industry rely on complex procedures that span multiple entities. That’s where our Utilities AI solutions can help. When it comes to the utilities industry, processes such as the collection and sharing of meter data, customer transfers, network billing and market settlements are all well understood and follow specific rules. This makes them great candidates for AI-powered solutions. How Utilities AI solutions can help The right AI solution can relieve your staff from executing repetitive tasks so they can focus more on handling exceptions and providing better customer service. As an example, instead of manually copying data from a form when a customer is moving between retailers, this process can be automatically streamlined with AI technology. Likewise, a back-office process such as settlement can be executed by AI solutions to allow your staff to focus on anomalies that may arise, rather than the vast majority of error-free transactions that pass through. Why choose CiGen for Utilities AI? CiGen has extensive experience working with providers in the utilities sector. In one case, we were able to use AI solutions to automate 85% of the process required to execute gas meter moves. ROI on the project was achieved in just seven months, and the process now runs 30% faster than before – with 100% data accuracy. Not only has this improved customer service but it’s also allowed the company to meet tightening regulatory obligations. You too can achieve these results by utilising the power of our AI-driven solutions and technology.

The following pages contain additional information regarding your proposed treatment options.Please reach out to us via the chat function if you have any queries. See Diagnosis Summary Diagnostic Summary hope this message finds you well. We're writing to you regarding your upcoming dental treatment plan. Your plan includes four appointments, focusing on both restorative and preventive care. Here's a breakdown of what each appointment entails and why they're important: Adhesive Restorations(Appointments 1 & 2) : We've scheduled two visits for adhesive restoration on teeth 24, 25, 26, and 14. These restorations involve applying a tooth-colored composite material to repair and strengthen your teeth. This process is crucial for teeth that have been affected by decay or minor fractures. It will restore their function and appearance, ensuring long-term dental health. Wisdom Tooth Extraction (Appointment 3) : This involves the removal of tooth 28. The extraction is necessary due to its condition, which could lead to further oral health issues if not addressed. Our team will ensure your comfort throughout this process. Calculus Removal (Appointment 4) : This is a cleaning session with our hygienist. Removing calculus (hardened plaque) is vital for preventing gum disease and maintaining overall oral health. Itâs a preventive measure to keep your teeth and gums healthy. Summary: The total cost of your treatment plan is $2095.00. We understand that dental treatments can be an investment, and we advise you to check with your health insurance provider as you may be eligible for some reimbursement. However, we cannot confirm the exact amount of coverage you might receive. At CoTreat Dental, we aim to maintain transparency regarding treatment plans and costs. If there are any necessary changes to your plan, we will inform you and discuss them before proceeding.

The Future of AI Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is the fourth industrial revolution, and we are currently in a fundamental period of change at a structural level (World Economic Forum). A.I. is altering the way we innovate and will inevitably touch every facet of our lives moving forward. Credits: TED Conferences LLC and McKinsey & Company Whitepaper The State of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Macquarie University AI Incubator by Richard Kimber, daisee Founder & Director Executive Summary Drawing from subject matter experts and industry best practice, we have compiled key insights into the current and future states of AI that are consistent with Government policy, Gartner and McKinsey.​ This introspective was also based on a 2020 Keynote: Latest Advances in Artificial Intelligence from Richard Kimber at the Macquarie University Incubator, leveraging the proprietary daisee transcription and analysis solution. ​Fundamentally, AI will be a part of the future ways of working and companies must proactively approach the challenge to emerge successful.​ AI is the next global Arms Race An AI strategy is key to navigating the complexity of the fourth industrial revolution.​ ​While the assumption would be to consider the United States or China as leaders, it is evident the United Kingdom has positioned themselves to confront the emerging grand challenges of:​ ​1. AI and data revolution; ​2.​ World leader in mobility; ​ ​​3. A shift to clean growth; ​ ​​4. Meeting the needs of an ageing society ​ ​​​In scope, these challenges are universal and similarly apply to Australia. The UK has developed a series of productivity foundations that are proven to increase improvements in and beyond the economy.​ 5 Foundations of Productivity​ 🇬🇧 1 2 3 4 5 Ideas Create the world’s most innovative economy​ Key Findings 1. From mobile to AI first: FAGMA (Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon) companies have enjoyed financial success that has accelerated in the pandemic because they focused on developing AI strategy at all levels of the business ​ 2. Unstructured data: is the key challenge to overcome for machine learning to be truly effective in optimizing productivity ​ 3. AI Service providers: Rather than investing intensive resources into internal AI, there will be emerging AI SAAS firms to affordably take advantage - The FAGMA companies have all consistently chosen to be AI first in their strategy. - The mystery behind ‘innovative and secret’ algorithms is now commonly understood.​ - The key point of differentiation is the approach to understanding and using data, and this is where FAGMA dominates.​ - Concerningly, the USA and China are the major players and there is a significant lack of Australian presence. ​ - The pandemic has accelerated the impact of an AI first approach, and the FAGMA performance shows in their financial success globally.​ What can the public and private sectors learn?​ - Become proactive, rather than reactive to encourage innovation. ​ - Move towards becoming a “Tech-Nation” that defines a technology strategy for the whole country. ​ - A committed partnership in innovation between businesses and universities to solve tomorrow’s challenges.​ AI vs Machine Learning - AI and machine learning are not just a new kind of software but are completely new and unique.​ - Machine learning is a sub-set of AI that trains models to predict outcomes. AI machine learning recognises patterns and the more data that you serve the algorithm, the better is gets at pattern recognition.​ - This is very different to normal, traditional software that uses rules-based logic in a very systematic way to determine if this happens, do that.​ - Machine learning may be very accurate, up to 95%, but will never be perfect. However, humans are not perfect; it is important to calibrate AI to what a human can do, and in this measure, AI can replicate a human level of accuracy.​ What is the AI hype? - AI has been over-hyped in the media repeatedly since 1956, but we are reaching a tipping point - as Gartner identifies.​ ​- Popular visions of AI reaching Singularity is unrealistic, however, real prediction is possible and the next battleground for companies and countries.​ - AI has the capacity to augment people and their performance, as we can spend more time being productive. ​ - While the results of some elements such as chatbots are unsatisfactory, there is a new horizon emerging in computer vision.​ Why is AI Important - Analytical tasks and finding patterns in data that was done by software, can be done more efficiently and at lower cost with AI​ - Advances in algorithms, training data, GPU’s and Cloud services along with greater interest and investment have created the perfect conditions to finally realise change.​ 1. Innovation: New products and services will emerge.​ 2. Efficacy & Velocity: Productivity and tasks will be achieved far more effectively and quicker. 3. Scalability: Tasks will be extended to more participants​ The opportunity of unstructured data - Computer vision is the key to understanding abstract concepts that work with AI and Machine Learning.​ - In 2013, there was a breakthrough – we could convert words into representation or vectors (Word2Vec) that explore the common relationships in words.​ - This allows AI to understand the context and meaning behind the words in a numerical sense.​ - It changed the way AI can evaluate abstract concepts into close approximations of meaning. This has opened extensive new possibilities with understanding the data. However, Most data is unstructured - just like our world. Language is the same, and for AI and machine learning to work, they need structure.​ ​ - 80% of corporate data will be unstructured by 2025 (IDC) ​- This is where Machine Learning and AI can make the biggest impact​ ​ - CRM systems will become autonomous in detecting information relevant to your customers rather than relying on static data​ - The data requires more storage, and it is harder to manage and protect with legacy solutions.​ - The amount of data is also growing, expected to reach 135 Zetabytes by 2025 (Data Age).​ - The magnitude of this would be to imagine attempting to collect and categorise every grain of sand on planet Earth for every Zetabyte of data! Why AI is essential for the success of businesses​ - No longer relying on historic data but rather, AI can be used to predict future opportunities and threats​ - Optimisation – AI will not only have a dramatic impact on how businesses develop their go-to-market strategy but how to optimise it across different segments​ - Churn prediction using insights from AI and machine learning – it is far easier to retain a customer than earn a new one​ What can be done?​ - Necessary Skills ​ Awareness is key to putting AI first. While technical knowledge at every level isn’t needed, CEO and leadership need to join the AI conversation rather than delegating to R&D. ​​ - Identifying relevant use cases​ Knowing when, where and how to apply AI is the most important barrier to overcome.​ - Defining AI Strategy​ By understanding AI at a leadership level, companies can develop effective strategies to realise the rewards.​​ How will AI Services work?​ - Like Software as a Service products (SASS), AI will follow a similar approach.​ - AI will enable businesses to increase the velocity of innovation and continuously evolve through rapid release cycling.​ - Fundamentally, AI as a service lowers the cost of entry for customers because it removes the costly development component and can be purchased or rented. - There are also several downstream integrations.​ We are daisee We are daisee, a conversational middleware that automates the quality management process. ​Fundamentally we deal with unstructured interaction data and create structure in it to assist our clients with unearthing actionable insight. ​Recognised domestically and abroad, daisee is named as a Cool Vendor by Gartner, and in the KMPG Fintech Global 100, one of 7 Australian companies. ​Watch the full presentation here​

Features Automated PROGRAMMABLE SCORECARD Get closer to the pulse of your business and ensure a flawless customer experience with our Programmable Scorecard™ The world’s first Programmable Scorecard™ replaces the traditional paper scorecard with an automated digital solution that works in tandem with the Media Player.

Script Adherence is an integral component of our Programmable Scorecard and the rating weight can be set to ensure that problematic calls will be highlighted for rapid remediation. These statements can be Verbatim – or an exact match of the words, or Non-Verbatim where they convey the understanding of the issue without having to use the exact words. DAISEE ESSENCE Discover the essence of your customers’ intent daisee Essence is a unique AI-powered feature that enables contact centres to better understand their customers' needs and reasons for contacting them. Using unsupervised machine learning, daisee Essence analyses every customer conversation and separates key categories and underlying drivers from general language to provide insights that can drive business decisions. This allows for a more efficient and purposeful use of human resources in the contact centre, as it eliminates the need for agents to manually update systems. It overcomes human bias and eliminates inaccurate data, providing a reliable view of the caller's intent and freeing up agents' time to focus on more important tasks. The high-resolution call trends are visualised in a simple user interface, making it easy to quantify trends, even the unexpected ones. daisee Essence provides a reliable view of the caller's intent, improving efficiency, reducing costs, and providing insights that can impact operational efficiency and customer experience. daisee's most recent version of Essence now categorises the reason for the call into a product or service category, and then identifies the underlying root cause driver for each of these categories. This enriches the insights and provides even deeper analysis of the voice of the customer, which can help elevate the contact centre to a source of strategic value in driving competitive differentiation. With daisee Essence, businesses can elevate their contact centre to a source of strategic value and make informed decisions that impact operational efficiency and customer experience.

With access to all the data associated with their own environment, users can create custom reports with a blank canvas and all the fields that matter. This means that users can get new insights in minutes, without needing advanced analytics skills or support. The user interface for Report Builder is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy to select the things that you want to count or see as a percentage, such as the number of high-risk calls or the percentage of calls under 60 seconds. Users can also select the fields they want to break the data down by, such as month, city, or agent. With this powerful feature, businesses can easily get the insights they need, leading to improved decision-making and better outcomes. daisee's commitment to an open data policy means that the data businesses send to daisee is still their data, which is enriched by machine learning models, giving users complete access and control over their data. Download the daisee REPORT BUILDER flyer DAISEE CHAT Maximize the potential of your chat interactions Over 80% of contact centres either use chat or plan to implement it. daisee Chat Insights allows customers to dive into the metrics that matter most in chat interactions. The Chat Insights capability helps customers keep track of their mix of phone versus chat-based interactions and shift towards more cost-effective interactions. daisee offers customers on the Genesys Cloud Platform an omnichannel experience within the core daisee platform. The daisee platform allows you to easily toggle between voice and daisee Chat giving yet more insight and a more tightly integrated experience. Interested in drilling down further on a specific chat? With daisee chat your QA can include: • Consolidated information about your agents chat performance. • An ""All Chats"" page to filter chats by date range and agent participants. • Focus on individual chats • Transcripts of chat conversations • ""Chat Player"" where you can inspect individual chat metrics, browse the chat transcripts and search for terms within the chat transcripts. We understand that businesses now want and need to understand the effects/abilities of their chat platforms in issue resolution. However, the way customers, bots and agents interact in a chat and the metrics used to measure the effectiveness of those chats are very different to voice/phone interactions. A chat can have multiple agents per chat and an agent can deal with multiple simultaneous chats. The chat dashboard allows daisee to provide an aggregated view of all chat activity between agents and customers, and the chat QA allows you to drill into specific chats based on those highlights.

Lagoon AI at the Edge Commercialisation Innovation capability Innovation programs Capturing underwater video footage in marine environments to measure and identify fish and sample populations has traditionally been technically and logistically challenging. With the Lagoon AI Camera Orb, Firetail Robotics has set out to revolutionise this process. In fact, we’ve partnered with leading Australian research and commercial organisations including Griffith University to develop what we believe is a world leading approach to accuracy and automation of underwater fish ID and measurement by creating a flexible, full featured and cost effective marine sensing platform. Current approaches use a BRUV (baited rigged underwater video camera) which is lowered into a fixed position with video later retrieved and fish species manually counted by an end user by watching the footage.These current processes consume hours of staff time. Time and cost factors limit how this information can be utilised for positive environmental and commercial outcomes. Lagoon AI can fundamentally change marine surveying. Our Lagoon AI Camera Orb solution will drastically reduce the time and resources needed to obtain actionable fish type, behaviour, size, and abundance data by using ‘AI at the edge’ – capturing and processing real time ocean imagery and via an AI trained cloud-based annotation functionality. Lagoon AI Fish ID comprises real-time fish count and sizing results at the edge (real time & on-site) and/or in the cloud (real time/delayed). The platform presents data to the end user via easy to use software. The Lagoon AI Camera is delivered to location by the Surfbee, our proprietary Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) and is complemented by a suite of proprietary products including a ground control station, hand controller unit and proprietary autopilot and long range radio, cellular or satellite link, meaning data can be actioned in real time anywhere in the world via the cloud. Lagoon AI System Why is innovation to transform ocean health important to you: “ We believe that innovation to transform the ocean is critical because our oceans have traditionally suffered from a case of ‘out of sight, out of mind.’ As a team dedicated to creating drones, autonomous vehicles and robots, part of our core belief is that these tools can help people see the world around them in new ways and perspectives. From our regional base, we see firsthand the impact of increasing climate variability on the agriculture sectors around our region – we know firsthand how important healthy oceans are to the health of the globe. We think that the ocean is the next frontier of creating greater awareness of the scientific, environmental and climatic impacts of the years of misuse and abuse of our maritime environment – in effect, removing the ignorance of the plight of the oceans by making it easier for people to understand them. We want to be front and centre in that effort and help tell the story of the importance of oceans” – Jack Hurley, Founder. Lagoon AI’s world Currently: Capturing underwater video footage in marine environments to sense and identify marine life and react to real time environmental anomalies from deployed sensors has traditionally been technically and logistically challenging. Current approaches use a BRUV (baited rigged underwater video camera) which is lowered into a fixed position with video later retrieved and fish species manually counted by an end user by watching the footage or traditional environmental sensors like the Xylem YSI EXO Multiparameter Sonde are lowered into water with data recorded and reviewed. Each of these processes consume hours of staff time and present various OH&S considerations. These time and cost factors limit how this information can be utilised for positive environmental and commercial outcomes. Our Response: Firetail has partnered with leading Australian research and commercial organisations including Griffith University to develop what they believe is a world leading approach to accuracy and automation of underwater AI visual and sensing classification by creating a flexible, full featured and cost effective marine sensing platform, named Lagoon A.I.  Lagoon AI features an ‘at the edge’ artificial intelligence capability, underpinned by the Lagoon AI edge device . Impressive as this system is,  it’s only as good as the underpinning robotic functionality – and this is where the Surfbee excels in delivering these sensing and survey technologies to the right spots. Surfbee and Lagoon AI working together The advantages of deploying the Lagoon AI sensing solution via the Surfbee platform quickly became evident from the very first ‘on water’ trials. Having a platform like the Surfbee with automated routing and pre drop deployment underwater depth and structure scanning drastically reduced the time and resources needed to obtain actionable data, as the team was able to identify the key survey areas in advance to ensure accurate ‘on water coverage.’  Because the Surfbee has best of breed AI at the edge processing and communications capability, this completely removes the time lag in gathering this data. Surfbee’s winch came into its own in variable depth environments, with the ability to automatically adjust sensor depth the key to maintaining exceptional survey data integrity.

About us Fast, Iterative, Agile. Firetail Corporate Focussed Regionally Executed When you think of the town of Albury, located on the border of NSW and Victoria, beaches, coral reefs and tropical weather aren’t exactly things that one might think about the region – and for good reason. With the nearest beach about giving you a bit of change out of spending four hours in the car, maritime drones and the development of cutting edge robotic and AI technologies perhaps don’t exactly spring to mind and dispel thoughts of lazy inland rivers, lakes and the nearby ski-fields for which the region is more widely known. However, Firetail is setting out to change the perception of what value looks like in the robotic, IOT and AI  sensing industry through its’ unique all in one platforms.

Στο σκοτάδι γεννήθηκε, ένας επιλεγμένος, η δύναμη να καθοδηγεί, μια ιστορία ξεκίνησε. Από την ταλαντευόμενη άμμο, ένα παιδί που πρέπει να ληφθεί υπόψη, Αυτός ο πεσμένος ήρωας, που θα περίμενε

AUTOMATION AND
SIMPLICITY

Μια σειρά από χρόνο δείχνει, ένα μέρος γραμμένο μέσα στις φλέβες της ιστορίας. Όπου ένα νεαρό αγόρι, που σε καμία περίπτωση δεν ήταν απλός θνητός, μεγάλωσε σε μια σπηλιά, στην κορυφή ενός ορεινού θύλακα.
Η απάντηση είναι στον κώδικα Μορς.

Auto Compounding

Archimedes automatically compounds vault assets when it is profitable to allocate assets to a new farm.

Community Centric

Mozaic protocol has taken no VC investment to date. The protocol was bootstrapped by a small team with the goal of bringing AI into the hands of everyday users.

Risk Mitigation

Harnessing Mozaic’s Vaults mitigates several risks involved with DeFi, including; yield decay, transaction fees, over choice and the risks that are incurred from moving positions from farm to farm, occasionally involving cross-chain transactions.

Mozaic employed the LI-FI infrastructure for cross-chain contract calls when moving vault assets from chain-to-chain.
GOOGLE CLOUD
The Google Cloud program provides a suite of support, tooling and infrastructure for Mozaic’s AI development. This gives us the freedom to redirect resources on developing the core technology itself, rather than its upkeep.

Relevance has prebuilt skills like making API calls, data processing, etc. Set triggers - Triggers specify conditions when a skill should activate. For example, trigger a Tool when the agent receives a certain query.Talk to your agent - That's it! Start interacting with your agent using natural language. The agent will improve as it has more conversations. What are tools? AI Agents complete work, to complete work they need to be given tools.With AI Tools, you can build custom integrations, LLM prompt chains or traditional automations. Effortlessly harness the latest Large Language Models, connect to APIs, tap into pre-built third-party integrations, or execute custom code with the Tool Builder.

What is speech to speech technology? Speech-to-speech (S2S) technology is a form of real-time language translation technology that enables spoken communication between individuals who speak different languages. Unlike traditional translation methods that involve converting written text from one language to another, S2S technology directly translates spoken language into another spoken language in real-time. How is speech to speech used? Game Development: Speech-to-speech technology in game development enhances player immersion by enabling dynamic and interactive dialogue systems. Players can engage with in-game characters through spoken commands or conversations, creating a more immersive and natural gaming experience. Additionally, STS facilitates voice chat features in multiplayer games, allowing players to communicate in real-time across different languages. â Education and Learning: In education, speech-to-speech technology supports language learning and communication skills development. It provides interactive language practice through speech recognition and synthesis, allowing students to engage in conversational exercises, pronunciation drills, and language assessments. Animation: Speech-to-speech technology is used in animation to synchronize character lip movements with spoken dialogue, creating lifelike and expressive animated performances. It streamlines the process of dubbing and voiceover recording by automatically aligning audio tracks with animated sequences, saving time and resources for production studios.Â Film: In the film industry, speech-to-speech technology supports automatic dubbing and subtitling of films for international audiences. It accelerates the localization process by generating translated dialogue tracks or subtitles in multiple languages, ensuring that films can be enjoyed by viewers worldwide. STS also facilitates audio description services for visually impaired audiences, providing narrated descriptions of visual elements during film screenings. Social Media Content Creation: In social media content creation, speech-to-speech technology empowers creators to generate voiceovers, captions, and subtitles for videos and multimedia content. It enables automatic transcription and translation of spoken content, making videos accessible to audiences with different language preferences. STS also supports voice-based chatbots and virtual influencers, allowing brands and influencers to engage with followers through conversational interactions. How does speech to speech technology work? Speech to speech (S2S) technology functions as a seamless translator for spoken language, allowing individuals who speak different languages to communicate effectively in real-time. The process involves several key stages: Listening and Understanding: The S2S system begins by listening attentively to what someone says in their native language. Using advanced technology called automatic speech recognition (ASR), it carefully analyzes the spoken input, identifying individual words and phrases. Translation: Once speech is transcribed into text, the S2S system employs sophisticated machine translation algorithms to convert the transcribed text from the source language into the target language. Synthesizing Speech: After the translation is generated, the S2S system utilizes text to speech synthesis techniques to convert the translated text into natural sounding speech output in the target language. This involves generating speech sounds based on linguistic rules, intonation patterns, and other parameters to create an intelligible and fluent spoken output that closely resembles human speech. â â Real-time Adaptation: Throughout the entire process, the S2S system continuously adapts and refines its translations based on context, linguistic nuances, and user feedback. This adaptive approach helps improve the accuracy and fluency of the speech output. What are the best practices for optimizing speech to speech output? Optimizing speech to speech (S2S) output involves ensuring that the translated speech is accurate, fluent, and natural sounding. Replica uses high quality automatic speech recognition, robust machine translation and natural sounding text to speech synthesis that delivers optimal speech output. Here are some best practices to help you achieve quality speech output: Language and Cultural Considerations: Consider linguistic variations, dialects, idiomatic expressions, and cultural nuances when translating and synthesizing speech. â â Testing and Iteration: Test the speech to speech output across different devices, platforms, and contexts to identify potential issues and areas for improvement. Continuously iterate on the voice and settings based on user feedback and performance analytics.

Socialtrait is a tool that uses AI to predict the outcome of your ideas, concepts or campaigns before you post them live. Its unique competence is predicting human behaviour in a social context, facilitating deeper market research. How is different is Socialtrait from traditionational market research? Socialtrait allows you to perform qualitative research at a large scale and quantify behavioural drivers, which allows marketers to make more confident decisions. The unique target audience generation algorithm defines each AI persona across 50+ demographic, psychographic, and behavioural variables. This capability enables extensive data analysis beyond the initial research parameters, unlike traditional methods, which are often restricted to the variables specified in the screener questionnaire. This approach allows for deeper insights and more dynamic data exploration. What benefits do I get from using this product? By using Socialtrait, businesses can realize significant time and cost savings. The platform facilitates the rapid iteration of ideas and strategies, delivering insights in a fraction of the time required by traditional research methods. Additionally, the ability to simulate and analyze a broad spectrum of consumer behaviours at scale allows companies to refine their market strategies more effectively, leading to better-targeted and more successful outcomes. How do AI Personas know anything about my brand? Socialtrait leverages state-of-the-art technology, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), to gather comprehensive knowledge about your brand and your target audience. By analyzing data from various sources Socialtrait generates actionable insights tailored to your specific needs. What's the level of accuracy of the results? How can I be confident in it? Socialtrait's accuracy is continuously refined through rigorous testing and validation processes. We have achieved over 95% accuracy on benchmarks that evaluate brand crisis situations, demonstrating our models' reliability in critical scenarios. Our models are also tested on the OpinionQA Dataset to ensure a high degree of human representativeness. Additionally, real use cases have shown that the ideas and concepts suggested by our AI personas are superior to those generated by other methods. While specific case studies and metrics can provide concrete evidence of our efficacy, our commitment to transparency ensures that you can trust the insights provided by Socialtrait for informed decision-making. Can Socialtrait help me understand my competitors? Yes, Socialtrait can offer critical insights into your competitors by analyzing relevant data and simulating how our AI personas perceive them. This information can empower you to refine your own strategies and stay ahead in your market. For example, compare your new digital content with your competitors to understand the reach and effectiveness. What kind of research work can Socialtrait be used for, and are there any limitations? Socialtrait is ideal for a wide range of market research applications, including predictive content analysis, precision audience analysis, and deriving insights adhering to local cultural norms and value systems. However, it's important to note that our virtual AI personas simulate consumer interactions based on data and cannot replicate experiences that require physical senses, such as taste or touch. Therefore, Socialtrait may not be suitable for research that relies on sensory or experiential feedback. For all other types of research, especially those requiring deep behavioural analysis, Socialtrait provides robust, scalable, and insightful solutions. How can I get started with Socialtrait? Is there any trial? We offer personalized one-on-one demos to demonstrate our predictive analytics platform. During the demo, you can see Socialtrait in action, explore its features in real-time, and discuss how it can be tailored to meet your specific research needs. As a trial, our team can work on a research objective or use case and tailor the demo accordingly. How much does this cost? The cost of Socialtrait services is tailored to your specific research needs. Factors such as the number of virtual communities created, the volume of data analyzed, and the complexity of the research outcomes influence pricing. Despite the comprehensive nature of our services, we offer competitive pricing that is a fraction of the cost when compared to traditional market research methods, with faster turnaround times. How does Socialtrait handle privacy and security of the data I share? At Socialtrait, we prioritize the privacy and security of your data. Our platform adheres to stringent data protection protocols, ensuring that your information remains confidential and secure at all times. All our client data is stored in MongoDB Atlas Cloud, which has gone through stringent requirements to attain various certifications like HIPAA, GDPR, ISO, PCI, and FedRAMP Moderate for various industry-specific, data locality and security controls and regulations. How long does it take to receive insights after submitting content for analysis? Upon submitting your content for analysis, you can generally expect to receive a detailed report encompassing hundreds of data points within one week. This timeframe allows our AI to thoroughly analyze data and simulate multiple community interactions, ensuring comprehensive insights. While traditional market research can take up to a month for similar depth, our AI-driven process significantly accelerates this, delivering results in just a few days. For projects requiring the creation of multiple target audiences or ingesting large quantities of data, additional time may be needed. However, with our upcoming self-service solution, we can offer insights within hours, further enhancing our efficiency and responsiveness. Can Socialtrait handle a large volume of data? Yes, Socialtrait can process large volumes of data to provide deeper insights. Whether you're analyzing a single campaign or multiple streams of data, Socialtrait's robust infrastructure can handle your requirements efficiently. How fresh do you keep the AI model updated with the latest market trends? Our AI models are continuously updated with new data as it becomes available, using technology that retrieves and integrates current information into the learning process. This ensures that the insights provided are always aligned with the latest market trends, allowing for accurate and timely market analysis. How is Socialtrait able to fully capture cultural nuances? Socialtraitâs ability to capture cultural nuances is driven by our sophisticated community generator, which utilizes over 50 parameters to create detailed AI personas. Each persona is crafted to be internally consistent, ensuring that individual characteristics, cultural backgrounds, and behavioural patterns are logically coherent. Furthermore, within a single community, these personas are designed to mirror or approximate the distribution of the real target audience. This approach enables our AI to simulate nuanced interactions accurately, reflecting true diversity and providing insights that are culturally sensitive and deeply rooted in specific community contexts. Additionally, we are continually working to refine our methodologies to eliminate global biases, enhancing the cultural authenticity of our simulations. How is Socialtrait able to capture the unpredictability of human behaviour? Socialtrait captures the unpredictability of human behaviour through the diversity and extensive number of our AI personas. Each persona represents a unique set of characteristics, ensuring a wide range of potential consumer behaviours and responses. Additionally, our platform supports non-linear interactions involving multiple participants, enabling dynamic and complex exchanges that mirror real-life social interactions. This capability enables our platform to provide insights that anticipate not just common responses but also less predictable reactions. How can I integrate Socialtrait into my existing marketing tools and workflows? Currently, Socialtrait is a standalone platform; however, we are actively working on facilitating integration with a variety of marketing tools and systems. We encourage you to tell us your integration needs to help prioritize our development. What is Socialtrait all about?

Linkedin FAQ Questions and Answers Everything you need to knoe about Solstice AI™ and what we do What are Solstice AI's products? We are currently offering two main products. Solstice SkyScan™ scans extended regions (such as entire states) and finds the exact locations, sizes, and orientations of all solar PV systems.  This includes residential (rooftop), commercial/industrial, and large-scale (solar farms). Solstice SkyFlow ™ forecasts the formation and movements of clouds, the main driver of solar variability, enabling highly accurate solar generation forecasts. We can provide solar generation forecasts for individual sites (including solar farms), or for entire regions. How does the solar identification work? We train artificial intelligence models on millions of images of solar PV systems.  They can differentiate between solar PV and solar hot water, and they can determine the orientations of solar PV systems. If the underlying imagery is good enough, our models have an accuracy of 97%. As a result, we can scan large regions and quickly identify exactly where all the solar PV systems are, and what their generating capacities are. How does the solar forecasting work? Using a combination of artificial intelligence and cloud motion vectors, we examine real-time satellite images and forecast how clouds will form and move in the next 2-3 hours.  Each artificial intelligence model is trained specifically on the region of interest.  This is important, since local factors such as coastlines, hills, or mountains can affect cloud formation.  The resulting solar generation forecasts are more accurate than if global irradiation models are used. Where does the data come from?  Can you do this anywhere in the world? For solar identification, we partner with several third parties to obtain overhead imagery.  For most populated regions there is high-quality imagery available that is updated regularly.  Some countries and regions have their own local data providers, but this generally has to be checked on a case-by-case basis. If data with sufficient resolution is available, we can procure it and analyse it. For solar forecasting, satellite imagery is available across the globe from several major satellite data providers. Who uses your products? Solar energy is the world’s fastest growing form of electricity generation, and all major markets need to prepare for a future in which much of our energy will come from solar. Energy market operators need to forecast solar generation to ensure that electricity supply matches demand at all times. Energy network operators need to understand where all the solar is (and where it will be) – both for planning purposes and to manage short-term voltage fluctuations in the grid. Energy generators (including solar farms) and retailers who trade in energy markets need to know in advance if there will be solar energy shortfall or oversupply, so that they can adjust their bidding accordingly. Entities who manage fleets of solar + storage assets, such as virtual power plants, need solar forecasts to optimally charge and discharge batteries. What kind of consulting do you do? We have an extensive background in providing state-of-the-art solutions to the energy sector. Every region is different and may have different needs and incentives when it comes to analysing and understanding solar generation or other large sources of data (such as smart meter data). Our PhD-qualified team can assist with applying state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to industry problems to help our clients reduce their costs and increase revenue.

Solar Generation Forecasting The primary driver of solar generation is cloud cover.  When large bands of clouds pass over major population centres, the output of all of the rooftop solar PV systems can suddenly fall or rise at the same time — leading to fluctuations equivalent to turning a large power plant on and off. This can make it very difficult to manage energy flows within the grid, and it can have a significant impact on energy prices. New data, new techniques Fortunately, we now have access to new types of satellite imagery that provide highly detailed information on the locations of clouds.  There are also new techniques arising out of the artificial intelligence motion prediction community that are incredibly effective at forecasting movement in imagery. Our proprietary forecasting solution applies these latest AI techniques to satellite imagery — enabling us to forecast the formation and movement of clouds at a high resolution.  Such cloud forecasts can improve the accuracy of solar generation forecasts by 20% over conventional solar forecasting approaches. Highly localized forecasts Cloud formation and movement is a highly localised process that can be heavily affected by conditions specific to a given site – for example how close it is to the coast, or to mountains, or to whatever other micro-climatic effects it may be subject to.  In other words, cloud motion forecasts become more accurate if they are targeted at and trained on data for a specific site. We train models specific to your use case, whether it is a solar farm, a region of your network, or a larger market region — taking these local effects into account.

Solar Identification Solar is the world’s fastest growing form of electricity generation. In Australia, more than one in three homes now have solar panels on their rooftops. Many other countries are following the same path. It’s great to have so much renewable energy!  But managing solar generation, which fluctuates significantly in response to moving cloud cover, can be very difficult. Many utilities have very little visibility on where all this rooftop solar PV is installed.  Our solar identification solution, Solstice SkyScan™, helps them to find it. Accuracy Solstice AI’s proprietary technology analyses aerial imagery and detects solar with incredible accuracy. This is useful for utilities that need to better understand their customer base, and for energy providers that may be looking to identify opportunities for community solar programs.  We can even combine this solution with socio-demographic data to predict future uptake of solar PV. Knowing where all the solar is is also incredibly important for forecasting – for further information, see our Solar Generation Forecasting solution. Adaptibility We are able to identify the size, capacity and orientations of individual solar PV systems and can scale up to entire regions or countries.  We can even identify different types of solar assets, like solar photovoltaic and solar hot water.

Tim McLaren 11/11/24 Tim McLaren 11/11/24 Dynamic Depth Decoding: Faster Speculative Decoding for LLMs The acceleration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with speculative decoding provides a significant runtime improvement without any loss of accuracy. Currently, EAGLE-2 is the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method, improving on EAGLE with a dynamic draft tree. We introduce Dynamic Depth Decoding (DDD), which optimises EAGLE-2's tree drafting method using a dynamic depth. This extends the average speedup that EAGLE-2 achieves over EAGLE by 44%, giving DDD an average speedup of 3.16x. Oscar Brown / Zhengjie Wang / Andrea Do / Nikhil Mathew / Cheng Yu ML Research Labs, Canberra, Australia Australian National University Abstract The acceleration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with speculative decoding provides a significant runtime improvement without any loss of accuracy. Currently, EAGLE-2 is the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method, improving on EAGLE with a dynamic draft tree. We introduce Dynamic Depth Decoding (DDD), which optimises EAGLE-2’s tree drafting method using a dynamic depth. This extends the average speedup that EAGLE-2 achieves over EAGLE by 44%, giving DDD an average speedup of 3.16x. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) ( Brown et al. , 2020 ) ( Touvron et al. , 2023 ) have demonstrated im- pressive performance over various tasks. However, their large number of parameters causes inference speed to be too slow for many applications. Speculative Decoding ( Leviathan et al. , 2023 ) addresses this to accelerate an LLM, known as the target model. For each forward pass, the algorithm uses a much smaller draft model to generate a se- quence of tokens to be inputted to the target model. Running the target model once is sufficient to ver- ify the tokens until one is incorrect and generate the token that should follow the correct sequence. This gives a speedup by generating more tokens per forward pass of the target model. Notably, spec- ulative decoding methods are lossless since every token is verified as correct by the target model. Extrapolation Algorithm for Greater Language- model Efficiency (EAGLE) ( Li et al. , 2024b ) is the state of the art speculative decoding method, with it’s key feature being the construction of a draft model using the embedding layer and LM head of the target model with a single trainable head in be- tween. On its first release, EAGLE used a method of generating a tree of tokens from the draft model and adjusting the target model’s attention mask to allow the entire tree to be inputted simultaneously into the target model. This tree has the structure shown in Figure 2 , with the best tokens generated from each previous token being on the left. Al- though this tree chooses the tokens with the highest draft logprobs outputted after each token, its struc- ture is static with no dependence on the draft model output. EAGLE-2 ( Li et al. , 2024a ) improves on this static tree method by introducing a dynamic draft tree. The tree uses a beam search by choosing the top-k token sequences after each run of the draft model as the next input to the draft model. The sum of all logprobs generated in a sequence of tokens is used as a heuristic for choosing the top-k. Conclusion In this work, we introduce Dynamic Depth De- coding, an optimisation of EAGLE-2’s decoding algorithm that increases the speedup of the current state-of-the-art speculative decoding method. We discover an opportunity to use the draft model’s confidence to determine whether to continue draft- ing. Since the heuristic check breaks lazy evalua- tion, we find that it is optimal to check the heuristic only a few times. We also compare our decoding al- gorithm to EAGLE and EAGLE-2 over a variety of models. Future work on speculative decoding that significantly improves on the speedup of EAGLE- 2 will most likely focus on optimising the draft model and the verification process, rather than the drafting algorithm.

In addition to a lack of training data on low-resource languages, we identify some limitations in the beam search algorithm used in Whisper. To address these issues, we fine-tune Whisper on additional data and propose an improved decoding algorithm. Andrea Do / Oscar Brown* / Zhengjie Wang / Nikhil Mathew / Zixin Liu / Jawwad Ahmed / Cheng Yu * Australian National University Abstract The performance of Whisper in low-resource languages is still far from perfect. In addition to a lack of training data on low-resource languages, we identify some limitations in the beam search algorithm used in Whisper. To address these issues, we fine-tune Whisper on additional data and propose an improved decoding algorithm. On the Vietnamese language, fine-tuning Whisper-Tiny with LoRA leads to an improvement of 38.49 in WER over the zero-shot Whisper-Tiny setting which is a further reduction of 1.45 compared to full-parameter fine-tuning. Additionally, by using Filter-Ends and Min Lookahead decoding algorithms, the WER reduces by 2.26 on average over a range of languages compared to standard beam search. These results generalise to larger Whisper model sizes. We also prove a theorem that Min Lookahead outperforms the standard beam search algorithm used in Whisper. Introduction Whisper has remarkable performance in transcribing multilingual speech audio into text [1]. While its performance with English and other high-resource languages is impressive, the limited availability of training audio data for low-resources languages is a challenge. As Whisper is open-source, researchers may enhance its performance with new training datasets and methods. In this paper, we investigate unconventional fine-tuning and decoding algorithms to improve Whisper’s performance in a low-resource scenario. While fine-tuning is common in practice, a systematic comparison between different fine-tuning strategies for an encoder-decoder model like Whisper has yet to be documented. In the work of Jain et al. [2], the authors froze most of the model’s parameters while finetuned only the final layer. Conversely, Rouditchenko et al. [3] finetuned the entire model on unseen languages. Both studies lack comprehensive explanations for their choice of fine-tuning strategies. To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study of fine-tuning strategies on Whisper, including full-parameter fine-tuning and partialparameter fine-tuning where gradients are updated only in parts of the model. We selected Vietnamese as our target language, but we believe the results translate to other low-resource languages since we did not utilise any language-specific features in our fine-tuning experiments. Whisper uses a beam search decoding algorithm with beam width n = 5 and log-probability (logprob) as the score function [1]. This is as opposed to the greedy algorithm which chooses the token with the greatest logprob at each decoding step. Although beam search outperforms the greedy algorithm, we suggest it can be further improved by filtering out certain sequences and performing Conclusion Despite having less trainable parameters, fine-tuning Whisper- Medium and Whisper-Large with high-rank LoRA yields comparable performance improvements in comparison to full-parameter fine-tuning. The decoupling of input and output embeddings does not harm the model performance but can occasionally surpass the results achieved through full-parameter fine-tuning. Furthermore, we suggest Filter-Ends and Min Lookahead as improvements to Whisper’s decoding algorithm. We prove that Min Lookahead is expected to outperform standard beam search, while empirical results verify this with particularly strong performance on low-resource languages. Future studies should perform fine-tuning experiments on more low-resource languages and investigate increasing the beam’s diversity as a potential improvement to the decoding algorithm.

Producing excellent transcription results with sample rates sub 2kHz, it is also capable of discerning and identifying overlapping voices. Auto-language Identification Transcription without the need to provide the language. This is vitally important in multi-lingual scenarios where the spoken language may change several times, and those listening to the audio may not know which language(s) are being used in the conversation. Auto-Speaker Identification Speaker identification provides several modes designed work for nearly any environment or scenario. Assign audio to individual speakers within a group where the speakers are not identified (dynamic speaker ID). Recognize specific speakers within a database of known voices. This enables the identification of individuals among numerous discussions.  In these cases, TSS will automatically identify the known speaker and label other participants as ‘unknown speaker #’.

With our emotional analysis models, it’s now possible to quickly understand whether your person of interest is overwhelmed, angry, anxious, or excited. This insight is also particularly valuable for sectors such as law enforcement, where this additional data point can help to ascertain whether a suspect is potentially lying about who they are or their intentions.

Our Decision-Making at the Sensor (DMATS) technology is a ruggedized, mobile machine-learning hardware solution that enables machine-learning capability that any operator, without technical expertise, can use in the field to identify targets of interest. DMATS can be connected to any sensor such as a camera or microphone, and it can be trained to identify people, field signs, vehicles, languages, keywords, and more. More eyes and ears in the field DMATS boxes can operate autonomously and make a positive identification in the field, without the need for constant data streaming back to base. Operate in contested environments Once a target is identified, alerts are sent in small data packet sizes (25KB or less) making it ideal for low-bandwidth theaters. On the move, or set and forget DMATS technology is designed to be deployed in a vehicle or stationary location for longer-term surveillance. One box, multiple targets DMATS boxes can search for multiple types of targets from a single sensor, with intelligence data shared securely to authorized operators."
turnto-26753a.webflow.io,Turnto-26753a,['https://turnto-26753a.webflow.io/about-us'],"About us Turnto is a healthtech startup based out of Australia, on a mission to democratise health breakthroughs for every single person. Our team A world-class team backed high-profile investors including the founders of Canva, Google Maps, Xero, and Afterwork. Our story I started Turnto after our family was told there were âno treatment optionsâ to help our son living with a rare type of Cerebral Palsy. So of course - I did what we all do - and turned to good old Doctor Google, and discovered the amazing world of private Facebook groups. I remember finding this blog late one night, of some family trying an orthopaedic suit. I was so desperate to try something - that I just ordered this piece of equipment on the spot. Until that day, our son couldnât sit. We put it on, and he sat for the first time. We took the suit off and he kept being able to sit. That was the moment we knew that there were things we could do to dramatically help our boysâ lives. But it was on us to find them. And so began this epic quest to find more treatments for our kids. The crazy thing is that we did. The things we were learning were already in the medical literature once I started digging. We canât afford to wait decades when we are living with these conditions today When we are first diagnosed with a chronic illness - we are not equipped with the information to manage it. There is no magic pamphlet with answers to all the questions we have. Weâre often told - âthere is no cure, good luck, and goodbyeâ. The burden is on us - as patients - to understand how to manage our illnesses. However, with 120 new medical papers being published every hour in biomedicine alone, nobody can keep up with this information overload. This is not to even mention that research states that it takes an average of 12 years for this medical research to translate into medical interventions. This is too long. âEvery single day I log into facebook and scan all the comments. In case someone mentions a new treatment I have never heard ofâ This is a story we hear every day. Low-cost and low-risk medical breakthroughs already exist. Many of them are lifestyle-based treatments.Â Academic papers and findings from clinical trials are generally available online, but not necessarily contextualized. Meanwhile, networks such as Facebook groups offer accounts of lived experiences and community support - but lack the searchability and academic credibility of research. Instead of doom scrolling the internet, we want to transform the search experience from years into minutes. I started Turnto so we donât have to go through years of personal research to find a handful of life-changing treatments. We want everybody to have them now.
