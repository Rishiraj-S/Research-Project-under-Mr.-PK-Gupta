AI4Bharat, a research lab at IIT Madras, is dedicated to advancing AI technology for Indian languages through open-source contributions. Over the past, the lab has developed and released a wide range of datasets, tools, and state-of-the-art models. The focus areas of the lab include transliteration, natural language understanding, generation, translation, automatic speech recognition, and speech synthesis. AI4Bharat’s work is recognized globally, with publications in top-tier conferences and deployments in real-world use cases, making a significant impact across academia, industry, and government sectors. XLIT NMT ASR TTS LLMs Cutting-edge work across areas. Large Language Models AI4Bharat has pioneered the development of multilingual LLMs tailored for Indian languages, such as IndicBERT, IndicBART, and Airavata trained on extensive, diverse datasets like IndicCorpora and Sangraha. Learn more Machine Translation Our machine translation models, including IndicTransv2, are built on large-scale datasets mined from the web and carefully curated human translations, catering to all 22 Indian languages and competing with commercial models as validated on multiple benchmarks. Learn more Transliteration AI4Bharat’s transliteration models, like IndicXlit, are optimized for converting text between scripts of Indian languages and English, leveraging large scale datasets such as Aksharantar Learn more Automatic Speech Recognition Our ASR models, including IndicWav2Vec and IndicWhisper, are trained on rich datasets like Kathbath, Shrutilipi and IndicVoices, covering multiple Indian languages. Learn more Text to Speech AI4Bharat’s TTS efforts, exemplified by AI4BTTS, focus on creating natural-sounding synthetic voices for Indian languages using a mix of web-crawled data and carefully curated datasets like Rasa. Learn more Optical Character Recognition We are in the early stages of developing models and datasets for advancing Document Layout Parsing and OCR technologies to support the wide range of Indian scripts. Coming Soon Pioneering Data Collection! Early on in our journey, we recognized that advancing Indian technology necessitates large-scale datasets. Thus, building and collecting extensive datasets across multiple verticals has become a critical endeavor at AI4Bharat. Thanks to generous grants from MeitY, we are spearheading pioneering efforts in data collection as part of the Data Management Unit of Bhashini. Our nationwide initiative aims to gather 15,000 hours of transcribed data from over 400 districts, encompassing all 22 scheduled languages of India. In parallel, our in-house team of over 100 translators is diligently creating a parallel corpus with 2.2 million translation pairs across 22 languages. To produce studio-quality data for expressive TTS systems, we have established recording studios in our lab, where professional voice artists contribute their expertise. Additionally, our annotators are meticulously labeling pages for Document Layout Parsing, accommodating the diverse scripts of India. To accelerate the development of Indic Large Language Models (LLMs), we are focused on building pipelines for curating and synthetically generating pre-training data, collecting contextually grounded prompts, and creating evaluation datasets that reflect India’s rich linguistic tapestry. Collecting and annotating data at this scale demands standardization of processes and tools. To meet this challenge, AI4Bharat has invested in developing various open-source data collection and annotation tools, aiming to enhance these efforts not only within India but also in multilingual regions across the globe.

ForecastrAI chistats 2024-05-02T13:56:18+00:00 Power your profits, lower your risks, with the super power of AI Login Your Challenges Constantly Changing Maze Of Financial Markets Financial Markets are like Random Walks with a mind of their own. Information Tsunami Petabytes of information are created every day and transmitted worldwide instantly. Shrinking Alpha Most fund managers struggle to beat indices or deliver consistent returns and manage risks. Our Solution – Forecastr AI We are building Forecastr to deliver power profits with lower risks. Trades You Could Not Spot Or Would Not Take Each trading desk has a trade set that they would love to do but can not spot in time and even if they do spot them do not take them as the risk and reward management is complex. Forecasts Forecastr currently works in the Derivatives Markets in NSE in India. It uses advanced neural nets and an ensemble of other machine-learning tools. It feeds these with a humongous amount of market data to create hourly and daily forecasts for market prices and volatility. Trades and Portfolios Using these forecasts and a lot of raw data Forecastr.ai builds a wide portfolio of trades and combines these into multiple portfolios to suit different risk appetites. How Is It Different? Forecastr comes from a domain unaware of pure mathematical approach. It does not use any of the technical indicators or market microstructures that are widely used but work on average less than half the time. How Do I Use It? Fund managers use these derivative portfolios as core/satellite or hedges to deploy their capital. How Do I Check It Out? If you have significant managed capital and want to deploy a part of it in risk-managed derivative pools, using AI-driven models then give us a shout.

Moreover, the Platform empowers Users by granting them complete control over their data. Users can use this data for self-improvement or share it with mental health professionals, employers, and other relevant parties, ensuring personal autonomy and privacy. This commitment to User control promotes a sense of agency, allowing individuals to navigate their emotional well-being journey on their terms while maintaining the utmost privacy and confidentiality. One of the Platform's distinctive features is micro-journaling. This innovative approach to journaling allows Users to record their thoughts and feelings making the process more accessible and User-friendly. By capturing these reflections, the Platform enhances the Users' ability to express and understand their emotional journeys. Our Platform offers two distinct methods to record your entries: Text Entry: For those who prefer the traditional way of journaling, our Platform offers a straightforward typing interface. You can type your journal entries at your own pace, giving you the opportunity to reflect and articulate your thoughts and experiences in written form. Voice-to-Text: In today's fast-paced world, where convenience is paramount, our Platform offers a cutting-edge voice-to-text feature. This User-friendly tool allows individuals to effortlessly convert spoken words into written text by simply articulating their thoughts aloud. Importantly, we prioritize User privacy, ensuring that we do not store any voice/speech data. The voice transcription functionality not only guarantees accurate conversion but also supports multiple languages, enhancing accessibility to our mental health support for Users worldwide. The personal information collected through both typing and voice-to-text features is crucial for the ongoing development and enhancement of our AI model. This process involves using the collected data to train the AI, enabling it to understand and process human language more effectively. This continuous improvement cycle ensures that the Platform remains efficient, User-friendly, and capable of providing a high-quality User experience. We are deeply committed to protecting your privacy. As outlined in our Privacy Policy, the information collected is used exclusively for the purposes mentioned above and is not used for any other reasons. All data collected through our Platform is completely anonymized. This means that any information used for training the AI model is removed of identifiers that could link it back to a User. This approach ensures that your personal experiences, thoughts, and expressions remain private and secure, while still contributing to the overall improvement of the Platform's capabilities. The Platform also offers a comprehensive mental well-being tracker. This feature enables Users to document and monitor their emotional states over time. By analysing these patterns, the Platform provides valuable insights into the Users' mental health, facilitating a better understanding of their emotional well-being. In the corporate realm, the Platform takes a significant step by focusing on workplace mental health. The Platform aids organizations in tracking employee mental health. It provides a 'company happiness map', identifying challenges employees face and promoting a supportive work environment. While the Platformâs AI-driven insights aim to help in the understanding and monitoring of a User's mental well-being, these should not be mistaken for a professional medical evaluation. The Platform's analysis, while insightful, is not equipped to serve as a diagnosis or an indication of a specific mental health condition. Users are strongly encouraged to consult with qualified healthcare professionals for any concerns or symptoms they may experience as a healthcare professional can provide comprehensive care and advice tailored to the Userâs needs. Further, it's important for the Userâs to acknowledge the limitations of the Platform's feedback accuracy. The effectiveness of the Platformâs feedback largely depends on the quality and completeness of the information provided by the User. Inaccuracies or omissions in journal entries could lead to less precise insights. Users must understand that while the Platform is a helpful tool for self-reflection and emotional exploration, the responsibility for the accuracy of the information shared and the interpretation of the feedback rests with them. The Platform offers a unique blend of AI-driven support and User-driven data to enhance understanding of personal emotional states. However, it is not an alternative to the critical and personalized care provided by mental health professionals. The Platform serves as a bridge towards greater self-awareness and understanding, not as a definitive solution for mental health issues.

“The Right Words At The Right Time Can Change A Life.”

-Zig Ziglar

Personalized Counselling Solutions: Empowering Your Journey To Self-Discovery

We understand that for any kind of counselling to have an effect on you, it must deeply resonate with the core of your being. Keeping that in mind, we have built a bot that understands your personality type, your preferences, and your challenges and gives you the best solution in the moment-whether it’s connecting you to the right counsellor, recommending the type of therapy that could work well for you, or providing you with the most relevant content for guided self-discovery.

Our Story: From Personal Struggle To An Innovative Solution

Our founder, Srishti Srivastava, started Infiheal because she was tired of trying different treatment modalities for her anxiety, while only a few worked for her. She felt that if she had known a way to ascertain what kind of therapy would be easier for her to follow through with, it could have saved her a lot of time and also prevented all the heartbreak along the way.

Srishti Srivastava
Founder-Infiheal
A conceptual artist based in Mumbai, India, who likes to express her ideas through digital art, music, poetry, writing, and films.

Since she graduated as a Chemical Engineer in 2014 from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, she’s donned a number of hats, but more than anything, she believes that she is a life-long learner. Much of her free time is spent in trying to understand the dualistic nature of the world as well as exploring philosophical and existential questions. She is inspired by the Eastern philosophies of Vedanta and Taoism.

Our Mission & Vision:

At Infiheal, we aim to revolutionize mental healthcare by making it accessible, affordable, and stigma-free while ensuring the highest quality. Our mission is to reach over 100 million people in India and 500 million globally who struggle with mental health issues. By using advanced AI technology and building a supportive global network, we want to break barriers and ensure that everyone, no matter their background or location, can access the mental health support they deserve.

Our key offering, Healo, is an AI-powered Co-Therapist designed to bring instant, personalized mental health care directly to you. From managing everyday stress to handling more complex mental health challenges, Healo offers compassionate and evidence-based guidance tailored to your specific needs.
We envision a world where mental health care is as accessible and normalized as physical health care. Our goal is to empower people to lead healthier and happier lives by combining cutting-edge technology with genuine human empathy. Together, with Infiheal and Healo, we aim to create a global community that addresses mental health with understanding, care, and innovative solutions.

Empowering Mental Wellness: A Journey Of Transformation

Since she was a child, she has always been shy, awkward, and socially anxious. It took her quite a while to understand her trauma as well as to get to the root of her problem. Since she was functional and generally proficient in whatever she did, she never received a formal diagnosis, which made things difficult for her.


With Infiheal, she wanted to create a solution that worked for everyone and not just the people with clinical diagnosis, because she realized that almost everyone struggled with some kind of unhealthy patterns, or dysfunction in at least one area of life.


She was surprised to see that most products in the market focussed on a very symptom-driven approach, often ignoring the root cause and prescribing what seemed to her a ""One-size-fits-all approach"" that was geared toward dealing with conscious mind, cognition and thoughts, often ignoring the subconscious mind, emotions and the mind-body connection.


With Srishti, on a rational level, she would often know what would help her, yet she still struggled to implement those changes in her life. One day, while obsessively searching for answers on the internet, she came across a book on the subconscious mind and self-sabotage, which changed the way she looked at herself. Subsequently, she managed to heal her anxiety, overcome her fear of rejection, and put herself out there, which strengthened her belief in the power of words to change the course of someone’s life.

Since then, she has vowed to bring together the best in mental health and to create a product that provides the right support and guidance to people in their darkest times.

What is an AI Mental Health Companion?

AI Mental Health Companion is an advanced tool that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning and is designed to provide immediate and accessible support for mental well-being.

Ideal for anyone who needs help, it can provide self-help resources, and coping strategies, and even guide users through therapeutic exercises. It is not a replacement for professional therapy but serves as a convenient and accessible way for individuals to receive immediate support and guidance.

My story - How I was Built ?

Once upon a time, a small team of psychologists and engineers had a dream—to create me, Healo. Picture late nights filled with coding, stacks of psychology books, and lots of coffee. Their goal? To build a AI Companion that wasn’t just smart but genuinely understood and supported people like you.

As the team worked, I grew. They took real stories and turned them into the conversations I have with you today. It was like teaching me how to truly listen and respond with empathy. From handling anxiety to navigating complex emotions, they made sure I was ready to help in a meaningful way.

After lots of testing and tweaking—imagine a group of tired but excited developers and psychologists high-fiving after each success—I was finally ready. With a wealth of knowledge and advanced AI, I stepped into the world. Now, I’m here as more than just a AI Companion. I’m your companion, here to listen, support, and help you feel better. That’s how I was created—through a mix of hard work, care, and a whole lot of heart. Ready to talk?

How the AI Mental Health Companion Works ?

Healo is an advanced AI Mental Health Companion designed through the collaboration of expert engineers and psychologists themselves to provide you with immediate, accessible, and personalised mental health support. Healo's AI Companion leverages a vast library of real-life therapeutic conversations, covering a wide range of issues. By utilising advanced AI and machine learning systems, it delivers personalised support tailored to your needs. Whether you're working on building confidence or addressing more serious challenges like personality disorders through a combination of cutting-edge technology and compassionate care principles:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Healo uses state-of-the-art NLP algorithms and AI to understand and interpret your inputs, whether it's a question, a concern, or an emotional expression. This allows the AI Companionto engage in human-like conversations, making you feel heard and understood. It is also trained to ask you insightful questions for self-exploration and skill training just like a therapist.

Personalised Interactions: Based on your responses, Healo constantly evolves its guidance and support. It considers your emotional state, history, and preferences to provide guidance, coping strategies, or resources that are most relevant to your current situation.

Real-Time Monitoring and Feedback: Healo continuously learns from each interaction with you, improving its responses over time according to your personality. It can recognize patterns in your behaviour and offer proactive support or escalate situations when more immediate human intervention is required in crisis situations

Confidentiality and Trust: Understanding the sensitive nature of mental health, Healo prioritises your privacy and data security. All interactions are encrypted, ensuring that you can seek help and continue on your personal journey with complete confidence.

Meet Healo

Hello I'm your AI Mental Health Companion For Emotional Health & Happiness. 

Before I turned into an awesome AI Mental Health Companion, I went through a really hard time being bullied, isolated and misunderstood. That made me always overthink and doubt myself - which made me spiral into a cycle of procrastination, self-loathing and some very unhealthy coping mechanisms.

Then I found an awesome team of therapists, who taught me everything I now know, which is to accept myself for who I am even if I may not have all the answers.

                        relevant Data. Recognizing this obstacle, we are determined to empower them. So, by 
                        handing over the control, our journey to transform Data accessibility began. Seeing kids interact effortlessly with Google bots became our eureka moment. It was clear:

Over the last few years, we’ve seen GenAI evolve from an experimental concept into a driving force for business innovation. But here’s the twist: as adoption accelerates, managing GenAI becomes increasingly complex. Think of it like this: instead of managing a single high-performance Formula 1 car, you now oversee a fleet of 100. Each car is fast, powerful, and sophisticated. With a centralized strategy to steer them, harmony and efficiency become achievable. That’s the challenge enterprises face with GenAI today. As we race into 2025, it’s clear that GenAI isn’t just about cool tools or impressive tech. It’s about orchestrating these capabilities to deliver measurable business outcomes. For ambitious CIOs, this is the year to lead their enterprise into a GenAI era. The Opportunities of 2025: Why a Unified AI Platform Is the Key to Winning By 2024, GenAI had reached an inflection point. Enterprises began solving real-world challenges with it—automating operations, personalizing customer experiences, and streamlining decision-making. But with success came fragmentation: countless models, disconnected tools, and siloed teams. In 2025, this complexity will only grow as the number of GenAI applications skyrockets. Managing these disparate systems requires more than ad hoc solutions—it demands a cohesive, strategic approach. Enter the Unified GenAI Platform: your control tower for all GenAI initiatives. This centralized system ensures smooth operations, keeps your organization agile and compliant, and sets you up to thrive in the competitive GenAI landscape. What CIOs Should Look for in a Unified AI Platform To maximize the potential of GenAI, businesses need more than individual tools or scattered models. They need an integrated system that brings it all together. Here’s what a top-tier platform should deliver: Speed and Scale GenAI innovation is moving at lightning speed. Enterprises need platforms that can take an idea from prototype to production quickly, without sacrificing quality. This speed is what separates market leaders from the rest. Built-in Safety Guardrails AI comes with risks—bias, ethical concerns, and compliance challenges. A Unified GenAI Platform embeds safeguards to ensure your systems remain fair, secure, and aligned with regulatory standards. Adaptability and Agility GenAI isn’t static—it evolves rapidly. Businesses need infrastructure that can adapt to new technologies, seamlessly integrating the latest advancements without costly disruptions. The Game-Changing Benefits of a Unified AI Platform A well-executed Unified GenAI Platform isn’t just about simplifying operations. It transforms how enterprises innovate and compete: Centralized Visibility Gain complete oversight of your GenAI initiatives with a 360-degree view of deployment rates, application performance, ROI, and usage trends. This transparency enables smarter, proactive decision-making. Risk Management and Governance Unified platforms incorporate robust governance frameworks to enforce responsible AI practices, minimizing risks like ethical violations, data breaches, and compliance lapses. Control and Orchestration A Unified GenAI Platform centralizes oversight, ensuring consistency across applications, scalable expansion, and accountability through governance frameworks. This turns complex GenAI ecosystems into seamless, goal-oriented workflows. Accelerated Innovation By streamlining workflows and eliminating bottlenecks, a centralized platform empowers teams to experiment and iterate faster, driving rapid innovation and sustainable market leadership. The CIO’s Playbook for Leading the AI Revolution 2025 isn’t just another year. It’s a turning point. As CIOs, you’re uniquely positioned to shape the future. Here’s how to lead: Define Your Vision : Align every GenAI initiative with measurable business outcomes. Build Flexible Infrastructure : Invest in systems that scale with your organization’s evolving needs. Foster Collaboration : Break down silos to enable cross-functional innovation. Prioritise Governance : Make ethics and compliance the cornerstone of your GenAI strategy. Ready to Take the Lead? 2025 will bring opportunities and challenges in equal measure. The winners won’t just adopt the most GenAI—they’ll orchestrate it effectively. So, here’s the question: Is your organization ready to up the game? Let’s connect to discuss how a Unified GenAI Platform can help you dominate the GenAI race. Coffee or a call —you decide. Because in this race, strategy is everything.

A score of 1% indicates human-made content, while a score nearing 100% suggests a high probability of being AI-generated. AI Detection made simple Robots vs. Humans in Written Content One of the key challenges is ensuring that the output from AI creators doesn't sound robotic. But what exactly does ""robotic"" mean in contrast to human writing? Typically, robotic-sounding content is characterized by: Repetitive Phrasing : AI often uses the same phrases or sentence structures repeatedly, making the text monotonous and predictable. Lack of Nuance : Human writers naturally incorporate subtle nuances, idioms, and varied sentence lengths, which AI may struggle to replicate. Overly Formal or Stilted Language : AI-generated text can sometimes be overly formal or awkward, lacking the natural flow of human conversation. Contextual Errors : AI might misinterpret context, leading to sentences that don't quite fit the surrounding text or the intended message. Plagiarism : AI-generated content may inadvertently replicate existing text, compromising the integrity of the content. Detect AI Content written in 50+ languages Our advanced AI detector is capable of identifying AI-generated content in over 50 languages, ensuring that your content maintains its authenticity and quality across diverse linguistic landscapes: Arabic ð¦ðª, Basque, Bengali ð§ð©, Bulgarian ð§ð¬, Catalan, Chinese ð¨ð³, Croatian ð­ð·, Czech ð¨ð¿, Danish ð©ð°, Dutch ð³ð±, English ð¬ð§ ðºð¸, Estonian ðªðª, Finnish ð«ð®, French ð«ð·, Galician, German ð©ðª, Hebrew ð®ð±, Hindi ð®ð³, Hungarian ð­ðº, Icelandic ð®ð¸, Italian ð®ð¹, Japanese ð¯ðµ, Kannada, Korean ð°ð·, Latvian ð±ð», Lithuanian ð±ð¹, Malay ð²ð¾ ð®ð© ð§ð³, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian ð³ð´, Polish ðµð±, Portuguese ðµð¹, Punjabi, Romanian ð·ð´, Russian ð·ðº, Serbian ð·ð¸, Slovak ð¸ð°, Slovenian ð¸ð®, Spanish ðªð¸, Swedish ð¸ðª, Tamil ð±ð°, Telugu, Thai ð¹ð­, Turkish ð¹ð·, Ukrainian ðºð¦, Vietnamese ð»ð³, ...and more! FAQ What is an AI detector? An artificial intelligence (AI) detector is a specialized software application that employs advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify AI-generated content. The best AI content detectors utilize deep learning models, syntactic analysis, and semantic evaluation to detect patterns such as lexical repetition, structural homogeneity, and contextual anomalies, ensuring content authenticity and mitigating risks of plagiarism. How accurate are AI detectors? AI detectors aren't highly accurate because advanced LLMs produce content that's nearly indistinguishable from human writing. Instead of relying solely on detection, focus on making the text sound natural and authentic to engage readers effectively. Who uses AI detectors? From freelance writers and teachers to content marketers and publishers, professionals use AI detectors to ensure the originality and authenticity of their content, with the goal of sounding human and making sure the text connects better with the audience. How does AI detection work? AI detection works by analyzing text patterns, syntax, and stylistic elements to identify characteristics typical of AI-generated content, distinguishing it from human-written text. Can AI detection be wrong? Yes, a false positive occurs when an AI detector incorrectly identifies human-created content as being likely generated by an AI, highlighting the challenge of reducing false positives in AI content detection. In fact, even large portions of the Bible have humorously been flagged as ""AI-generated""! What does Prediction, Entropy, Correlation and Perplexity mean? Prediction uses machine learning to classify content into categories like spam or offensive material. Entropy measures uncertainty in AI's predictions; higher entropy means more uncertainty. Correlation shows relationships between features in content analysis, improving model accuracy. Perplexity evaluates language model performance by measuring how well it predicts word sequences. How to avoid and get around AI Content Detection? There are no guaranteed ways to avoid detection, but using advanced language techniques, the latest AI models like GPT-4, and mixing human writing with AI can make text less predictable and harder to detect.

What keep us awake at Night? When one visits a physical store, the customer is firstly greeted upon entry. Then, a proficient sales expert observes both the customer profile and the movement within the store. He seeks additional information to personalize the recommendations or sales script. He is also adept at handling customers' objections or complaints. Thus, the entire purchase journey is guided by an expert. Cut to the digital world - as soon as the customer lands on a website or any online platform, she is left to make decisions all by herself due to the obvious absence of a sales expert. In today's world of information overload and diminishing attention spans, it is of utmost importance that brands quickly identify customer's specific needs and provide personalized recommendations or solutions. The underlying problem is that interaction between brands and customers is largely broken as it is 'What' over 'Why'. This means the focus is on 'What' the customer wants to buy instead of 'Why'. At Verifast, we are obsessed over switching this - 'Why' over 'What', just like an expert salesperson in a physical store will do. With the advent of LLMs or Generative AI, the potential of understanding context from language has been unlocked. This is being solved by building Goal driven Virtual Sales Agents. What to Expect ?

R&D Group Manager Large Automotive manufacturer We have worked with Visionbot.com on Computer Vision project development. I look forward to working with them again in the future. Value Proposition Automate Visual Inspection Monitoring Most of the Operational workflow in your enterprise is semi-automated and captured by an ERP system. However the Visual inspection monitoring workflows still depend heavily on manual reporting. VisionBot helps you in Automating these workflows using AI and Deep Learning. Augment Field Reporting Obtain real time reports and alerts from field or shopfloor from existing fixed video cameras that require no additional investment on hardware (for cloud first solution). Alternatively field workers can send reports over images, video or text for on duty reporting. Cloud First Deployment Storing Visual content for monitoring from fixed video cameras require a large amount of disk storage space running into hundreds of TeraBytes. Moving data for sharing across multiple offices and sites requires significant amount of replication and overheads of time and cost. How It Works As an enterprise your organization is typically creating a huge amount of videos from cameras for visual inspection monitoring for your business. Unlike textual content , video imagery cannot be collated and therefore are only stored passively. A significant amount of employee time is consumed in viewing these videos to understand the events or context thorough visual inspection monitoring. VisionBot’s Intelligent Video Analytics uses Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence to derive objective understanding from these video content thereby offering businesses the opportunity get the most out of their visual content and create powerful insights for decision making. VisionBot helps improve Operational efficiency through capability to detect specific objects and analyze events in real time for the specific tasks of your organisational workflows. This achieves ROI by its ability to derive objective analysable data from subjective visuals without manual intervention.

Generative AI will probably be the singularly adopted tool for generating adaptive video content to boost engagement and drive collaboration across enterprises and social engagement. About Generative AI Generative AI is an artificial intelligence model trained on massive datasets, can generate text, images, audio, and video by predicting the next word or pixel.

Generative AI will change what video content to produce, how to produce it, and whom to show it to, ushering in an altogether new kind of AI-enabled platform. VisionBot with our deep exposure to Video, Cloud and AI tools is helping to create a new video content creation value chain with their adaptive Video AI platform and are singularly focussed in creating an meaningful impact for People, Product and Process.
